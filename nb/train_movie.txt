+1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life . 
-1 certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
-1 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
-1 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
+1 pretty good little movie . 
-1 the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
+1 bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
-1 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
+1 spare yet audacious . . . 
+1 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
-1 the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
+1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
+1 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
+1 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh . 
+1 about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . 
-1 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
+1 about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
+1 the performances are remarkable . 
+1 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
+1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
-1 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
+1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
+1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
-1 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
+1 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values . 
+1 the formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
+1 sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
+1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
-1 can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
+1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
+1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
-1 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
-1 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
-1 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
-1 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
-1 like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
-1 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
+1 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind . 
-1 there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
+1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
+1 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
+1 harmless fun . 
+1 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
-1 maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
+1 try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
-1 do not see this film . 
-1 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
-1 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
+1 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
-1 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
-1 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
-1 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
-1  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
-1 there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
+1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
-1 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
-1 its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
-1 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
+1 filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
+1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
-1 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
+1 hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 
-1 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
-1 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
-1 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
+1 it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
+1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
-1 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
+1 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone . 
+1 don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
+1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
+1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
-1 there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
+1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
-1 this is really just another genre picture . 
-1 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
+1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
+1 great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
-1 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crhme br{lie . 
-1 imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
-1 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
-1 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
-1 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
+1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
-1 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
-1 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
-1 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
-1 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
-1 propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
-1 it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
-1 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
-1 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
+1 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
-1 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
+1 is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief . 
-1 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
-1 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
+1 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
+1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
+1 it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
-1 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
-1  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
-1 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
-1  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
-1 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
-1 the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
-1 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
-1 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
+1 the film oozes craft . 
-1 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
-1 a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
-1 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
+1 it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
-1 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
+1 finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
-1 nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
+1 ferrara's best film in years . 
+1 as unseemly as its title suggests . 
+1 [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
-1 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
-1 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
+1  . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 
-1  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
-1 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
+1 throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
+1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
-1 collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
-1 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
+1 there is truth here
-1 never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
-1 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
-1 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
+1 you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated . 
-1 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
+1 true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable . 
+1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
+1 barry convinces us he's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
-1 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
+1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
+1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
-1 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
+1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
-1 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
+1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
+1 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch . 
-1 a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
+1 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing . 
-1 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
+1 there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
-1 a era do gelo diverte , mas nco convence . I um passatempo descompromissado – e ss . 
-1 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
-1 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo mmstico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensacisn de inconformidad que hace pensar mas de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
-1 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
-1 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
+1 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
+1 the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 
+1 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
+1 despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
+1 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
+1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
-1 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
+1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
+1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
+1 an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
+1 it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
+1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
+1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
-1 marinated in clichis and mawkish dialogue . 
+1 i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
+1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
+1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
+1 two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
-1 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
-1 maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
-1 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
-1 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
-1 when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
+1 sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing . 
-1 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
-1 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
-1 let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
-1 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
+1 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
+1 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
+1 charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
-1 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
-1 yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
-1 nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
+1 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
+1 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
-1 this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
-1 in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
-1 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
-1 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
+1 [an] absorbing documentary . 
+1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
-1 once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
+1 like mike is a harmlessly naa$e slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
+1 a no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
-1 though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
-1  . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
-1 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
+1 it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
-1 many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
+1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
-1 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
+1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
+1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
-1 despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
+1 will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
+1 puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman . 
+1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
+1 mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
+1 this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
-1 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
+1 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
-1 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
-1 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
-1 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
+1 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
+1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
-1 unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
+1 what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
-1 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
+1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
+1 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
+1 a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
+1 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
+1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
-1 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
+1 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
+1 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get . 
-1 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
-1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
+1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
+1 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
+1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
-1 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
+1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
-1 [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
+1 sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
+1 a funny film . 
-1 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
+1 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . 
+1 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
+1  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
-1 it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
-1 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
-1 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
-1 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
+1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
+1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
-1 just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
-1 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
+1 though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . 
+1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
+1 a delightful coming-of-age story . 
-1 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
+1 a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
+1 mais um momento inspirado de david fincher . 
+1 zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
-1 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
+1 i couldn't recommend this film more . 
-1 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
+1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
-1 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
+1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
+1 it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
+1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
-1 the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
-1 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
+1 mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
-1  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
-1 it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
+1 i don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it's a dish that's best served cold . 
+1 most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
-1 far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
-1 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
-1 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
-1 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
-1 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
-1 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
-1 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
-1 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
+1 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
-1 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
+1 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
+1 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
-1 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
-1 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
-1 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
-1 the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
+1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
+1 amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . 
-1 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
-1 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
+1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
+1 singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs — a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story — but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
-1 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
-1 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
-1 sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
+1 an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama . 
-1 [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
-1 more tiring than anything . 
+1 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . 
-1 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
+1 contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memg^ia . 
+1 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
+1 even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
-1 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
-1 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
+1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
+1  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
-1 diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
-1 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
-1 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
+1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
+1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
-1 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
+1 leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
-1 an overstylized , puried milange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
+1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
+1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
-1 it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
+1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
-1 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
-1 a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
-1 represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
+1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
-1 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
+1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
-1 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
+1 hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
-1 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
-1 a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
-1 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
-1 a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
+1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
-1 the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
-1 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
-1 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
+1 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
+1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
-1 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
+1 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
+1 part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
-1 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
+1 there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
-1 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
+1 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
+1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
+1 we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . 
-1 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
+1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
-1 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
-1 not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
-1 choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
+1 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . 
-1  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
+1 wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
-1 none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
-1 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
+1 it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
-1 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
+1 an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else . 
-1 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
+1 certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
+1 a good thriller . 
+1 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
-1 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
+1 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
+1 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . 
+1 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession . 
-1 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
+1 as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile . 
-1 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
+1 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
+1 it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
-1 we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
+1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
+1 as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
-1 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
-1 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
+1 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
-1 to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
-1 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
-1 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
-1 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
-1 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
+1 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined . 
+1 i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest . 
-1 bearable . barely . 
+1 like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
-1 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
+1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
-1 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
+1 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) . 
-1 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
-1 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
+1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
-1 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
+1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
-1 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
-1 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
+1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country . 
+1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
-1 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
+1 you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
-1 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
-1 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
+1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
+1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
-1 wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
-1 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
-1 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
+1 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
-1 when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
+1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
-1 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
-1 what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
+1 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
+1 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
-1 something must have been lost in the translation . 
-1 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
-1 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
-1 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
+1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
+1 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
+1 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
-1 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
-1 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
+1 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
+1 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
-1 meandering and confusing . 
-1 a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
+1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
-1 o stimo esforgo do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos sco explicados . 
-1 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
+1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
-1 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
-1 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
+1 a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . 
-1 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
-1 the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
+1 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
-1 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
+1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
+1 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
+1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
+1 a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
-1  . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
+1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
-1 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
+1  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
+1 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
-1 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
-1 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
-1 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
-1 [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
+1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
+1 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox's work . 
-1 spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
-1 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
+1 you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit . 
+1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 
-1 in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
+1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
+1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
+1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
-1 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
-1 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
+1 the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
+1 if mr . zhang's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian . 
-1 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
-1  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
-1 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
-1 feeble comedy . 
-1 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
-1 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
+1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie . 
-1 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
-1 there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
+1 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
-1 juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
+1 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
-1 a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
-1 jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
+1 never once predictable . 
+1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
+1 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
+1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
-1 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
-1 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
-1 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
+1 an absurdist spider web . 
-1 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
+1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
-1 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
-1 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
-1 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
+1 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
+1 ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling . 
+1 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
-1 don't waste your money . 
+1 surprisingly powerful and universal . 
-1 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
-1  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
+1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
+1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
-1 the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
+1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
-1 reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
+1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
+1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
+1 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
-1 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
+1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
+1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess . 
+1 it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
-1 will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
-1 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
+1 in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
-1 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
-1 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
+1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
-1 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
-1 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
+1 ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
+1 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
+1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
+1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
+1 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 
-1 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
+1 very well-written and very well-acted . 
+1 while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
+1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
-1 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .

-1 i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
+1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .

+1 you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
+1 this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
-1 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
-1 there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
+1 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film . 
+1 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
+1 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
+1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
-1 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
+1 majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times . 
-1 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
-1 a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
+1 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time . 
-1 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
+1 robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
-1 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
-1 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
+1 the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages . 
+1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
+1 psychologically savvy . 
+1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
-1 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
-1 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
-1 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
-1 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
-1 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
-1  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
+1 one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
-1 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
+1 the movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
-1 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
+1  " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
+1 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
-1 eh . 
-1 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
+1 twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
-1 whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
-1 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
-1 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
-1 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
-1 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
+1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
+1 intriguing and stylish . 
+1 this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
-1 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
+1 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
-1 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
+1 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count . 
+1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
-1 when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
+1 daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 
+1 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
-1 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
-1 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
+1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
-1 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
+1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
+1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
+1 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
+1 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
-1 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
-1 after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
+1 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
-1 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
+1 strange it is , but delightfully so . 
+1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
-1 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
-1 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
-1 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
-1 'carente de imaginacisn , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un apice de romance , es una verdadera pirdida de tiempo y dinero'
-1 first-time director joco pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
-1 ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
+1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
-1 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
+1 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
+1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
+1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
+1 a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
-1 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
+1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
-1 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
+1 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
-1 julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
+1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
-1 the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
-1 the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
-1 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
+1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
+1 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
+1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
-1 the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
-1 it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
-1 every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
-1 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
-1 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
+1 canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
-1 a timid , soggy near miss . 
+1 some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
-1 more trifle than triumph . 
+1 ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '
-1 an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
-1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
+1 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
+1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
-1 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
+1 the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
+1 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
-1 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
-1 star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
-1 we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
-1 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
-1 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
-1 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
+1 light , cute and forgettable . 
-1 one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
-1 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
+1 insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
-1 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
+1 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
-1 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
+1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
-1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
+1 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 
-1 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
+1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
-1 a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
-1 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
-1 [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
+1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
+1 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
-1 gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
+1 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
-1 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
+1 the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . 
-1 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
-1 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
+1 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
-1 the movie bounces all over the map . 
+1 there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
-1 while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
-1 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
+1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
+1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
+1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
-1 more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
-1 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
-1 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
+1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
-1 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
-1 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
+1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
+1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
-1 …the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
-1 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
-1 the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
-1 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
-1 the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
+1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
+1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
-1 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
-1 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
-1 presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
-1 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
-1 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
-1 the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
-1 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
+1 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
+1 a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
-1 what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
-1 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
+1 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
-1 crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
+1 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
-1 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
-1 under-rehearsed and lifeless
-1 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
-1 but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
+1 it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
+1 a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
+1 good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . 
-1 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
+1 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
-1 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
-1 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
-1 excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
-1 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
+1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
-1 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
+1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
+1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
-1 while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
-1 paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
-1 hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
+1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
+1 it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' . 
-1 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
-1 replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
+1 it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
-1  . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
-1 everything is off . 
-1  . . . hypnotically dull . 
+1 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
+1 a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
-1 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
+1 the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
-1 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
+1  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
+1 this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
-1 strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
+1 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
-1 there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
-1 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
+1 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
-1 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
+1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
-1 there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
+1 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
-1 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
-1 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
-1 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
-1 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
-1 could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
-1 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
-1 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
-1 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
+1 polished , well-structured film . 
+1 it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
-1 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
+1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
-1 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
-1 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
-1 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
+1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
+1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
+1 [a] satisfying niblet . 
-1 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
+1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
-1 if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
+1 often hilarious . 
+1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
+1 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
-1 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
+1 i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
-1 dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
-1 hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
+1  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
+1 the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
-1 from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
+1 [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
-1 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
+1 saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . 
-1  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um… . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
-1 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
+1 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 
-1 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
-1 a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
+1 boisterous , heartfelt comedy . 
+1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
+1 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
+1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
-1 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
-1 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
-1 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
-1 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
-1 for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
-1 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
+1 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
-1 the comedy is nonexistent . 
-1 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
+1 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
-1 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
+1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
-1 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
-1 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
-1 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
-1 like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
+1 the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
+1 an ambitious and moving but bleak film . 
-1 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
-1 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mitier . 
+1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
-1 it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
-1 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
-1 so-so entertainment . 
-1 i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
+1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
+1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
+1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
-1 time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
+1 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan josi campanella's reputation in the united states . 
+1 a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done . 
+1 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
+1 delightfully rendered
-1 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
+1 the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
+1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
-1 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
-1  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
-1 if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
-1 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
+1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
-1 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
-1 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
+1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
-1 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
+1 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
+1 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
-1 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
+1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
-1 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
-1 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
+1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
-1 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
-1 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
+1 although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
+1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
+1 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
-1 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
-1 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
+1 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
+1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
-1 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
+1 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
+1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
-1 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
-1 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
-1 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
+1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
-1 watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
+1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
+1 a taut , sobering film . 
-1 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
+1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
+1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
-1 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
-1 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
+1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
+1 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
-1 as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
+1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
-1 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
-1 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
-1 everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
+1 godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
-1 mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
+1 the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
-1 none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
-1 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
+1 while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . 
-1 mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
+1 damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
+1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 
-1 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amilie . 
+1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodgcar style . 
+1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
+1 a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
-1 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
-1 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
+1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
+1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
-1 more of a career curio than a major work . 
+1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
-1 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
-1 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
-1 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
-1 amazingly dopey . 
-1 there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
-1 the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a souffli gone wrong . 
-1 violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
+1 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
-1 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
-1  . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
-1 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
+1 a fun family movie that's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , 'it's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
-1 this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
-1 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
-1 oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
-1 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
-1 shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
-1 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
-1 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
-1 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
-1 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
+1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
+1 like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
-1 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
+1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
+1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
+1 it's up to you to decide whether to admire these people's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of american life . 
+1 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
-1 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
+1 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
+1 it's quite diverting nonsense . 
+1 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit . 
+1 another best of the year selection . 
+1 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
-1 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
-1 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
+1 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
+1 i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
+1 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
-1 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
+1 it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
-1  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
+1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
+1 unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
-1 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
-1 [a] slummer . 
+1 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 
-1 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
+1 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
+1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
+1 the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
+1 tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
+1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
-1 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
-1 too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
+1 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
+1 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 
-1 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
-1 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
-1 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
-1 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
+1 invincible is a wonderful movie . 
+1  . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought . 
-1 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
-1 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
+1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
+1 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
+1 maryam is more timely now than ever . 
+1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
+1 shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
-1 it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
+1 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
-1 the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
-1 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
-1 less than fresh . 
-1 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
-1 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
+1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
-1 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
+1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
+1 this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
+1 compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 
+1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
+1 it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
+1 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
-1 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
+1 even better than the first one ! 
-1 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
+1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
+1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
+1 a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is . 
+1 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
-1 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
-1 boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
+1 superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
+1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
-1 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
+1 proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 
+1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
-1 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
-1 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
+1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
-1 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
-1 narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
-1 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
-1 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . 
-1 doesn't add up to much . 
+1 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens . 
+1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
+1 'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
-1 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
-1 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
+1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
+1  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
+1 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
+1 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
+1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
+1 y tu mama tambiVx es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quiza el proyecto mIZ arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuargZ
-1 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffi and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
-1 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
+1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
-1 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
+1 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
-1 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
+1 if you like peace , you'll like promises . 
+1 with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry . 
+1 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . 
+1 perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though . 
+1 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
+1 an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
+1 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works . 
+1 it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious . 
-1 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
-1 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
+1  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
+1 refreshing . 
-1 a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
+1 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation . 
+1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
+1 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
-1 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
+1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
+1 with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
-1 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
-1 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
+1 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
+1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . 
-1 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
-1 nothing about it fits . 
-1 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
+1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
-1 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
+1 suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . 
-1 it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
-1 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
-1 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
+1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
-1 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
+1 by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . 
+1 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 
+1 the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
-1 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
+1 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
+1 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
+1 the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority . 
+1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
-1 feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
+1 an intoxicating experience . 
-1 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
+1 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
-1 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
-1 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
+1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
-1 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
+1 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
+1 just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
-1 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
-1 a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
-1 muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
-1 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
+1 even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
-1 suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
+1 a pleasant romantic comedy . 
-1 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
+1 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
+1 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
+1 for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride . 
-1 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
-1 feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
+1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
-1 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
+1 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
-1 as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
-1 new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
-1 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
-1 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .

+1 a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
+1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
+1 full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .

-1 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
+1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
+1 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animi tradition and its defining philosophical conscience .

-1 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
+1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
-1 muddled , trashy and incompetent
+1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
-1 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
+1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
+1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
-1 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
+1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
+1 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents . 
-1 grating and tedious .

-1 white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .

+1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia f]Xmica imposible de olvidar'
+1 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
+1 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
+1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
-1 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .

-1 a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
+1 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
+1 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
-1 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
+1  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
+1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .

+1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy .

+1 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
+1 offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
-1 a dreary indulgence . 
+1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .

+1 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing . 
+1 it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
+1 it's so good that you can practically see the hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable american remake . 
-1 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
+1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
+1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
+1 one from the heart . 
+1 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking . 
-1 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
-1 though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
+1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
-1 [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .

+1 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
+1 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . 
+1 me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
-1 jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
+1 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
-1 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film .

-1 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
-1  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
-1 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
-1 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
-1 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
-1 as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
-1 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
-1 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
+1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
+1 this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
+1 i've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . 
-1 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
-1 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
+1 like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
+1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
+1 a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . 
-1 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
-1 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
-1 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
-1 even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
-1 shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
+1 the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
+1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
+1  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
+1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
-1 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
+1 the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
-1 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
-1 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
+1  . . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war . 
+1 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
+1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
-1 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
-1  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
+1 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
+1  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
+1 despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
+1 the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
-1 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
+1 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest . 
+1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
-1 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .

+1 what i saw , i enjoyed .

-1 murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
-1 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
+1 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
-1 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
-1 it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .

+1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
+1 vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
+1 mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
+1 formuliac , but fun . 
+1 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
+1 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . 
-1 i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
+1 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
-1 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
+1 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
+1 intimate and panoramic . 
-1 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
+1 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
-1  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
-1 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
-1 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
+1 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
+1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
-1 been there done that . 
+1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
-1 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
+1 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
+1 there's very little sense to what's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash . 
+1 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
-1 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
-1 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
-1 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
+1 good ol' urban legend stuff . 
+1 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
+1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale – as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
-1 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
+1 the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
-1 one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
-1 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
-1 extremely bad . 
-1 the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
+1 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
-1 so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
-1 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
+1 francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
-1 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
+1 the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
+1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
-1 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
+1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
+1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
+1 you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
-1 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
-1 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
-1 all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
-1 has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
+1 it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
+1 graSJs Gy interaT^es entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se nLv apenas uma histg^ia divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguiTLo , mas tambVw um belo estudo de personagens . 
-1 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
+1 exhilarating , funny and fun . 
-1 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
+1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
-1 a noble failure . 
+1 a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
+1  . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
+1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
-1 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
+1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
-1 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
+1 a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 
+1 twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down – greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . 
+1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
+1 the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
+1 a well-executed spy-thriller . 
-1 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
+1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
-1 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
-1 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
-1 the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
+1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
-1 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
-1 has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
+1  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
+1 works because we're never sure if ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks . 
-1 rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
+1 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
+1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
-1 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
-1 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
+1 [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
-1 peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
-1 it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
+1 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe . 
-1 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
+1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
-1 children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
+1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
+1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
-1 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
+1 an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
-1 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
-1 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
+1 funny but perilously slight . 
+1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
+1 it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
+1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
+1 the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . 
+1 kinnear gives a tremendous performance . 
-1  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
+1 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
-1 confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
-1  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
+1 nettelbeck . . . has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
+1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
-1 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
-1 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
-1 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
-1 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
-1 self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
-1 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
-1 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
-1 one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
-1 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
-1 you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
+1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
-1 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
-1 what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
+1 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
+1 if there's no art here , it's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days . 
+1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
+1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
-1 most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
-1 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
-1 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
-1 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
-1 on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
-1  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
+1 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . 
-1 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
-1 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
-1 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
-1 it's not original enough . 
-1 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
-1 with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
-1 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
+1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
+1 watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . 
+1 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
+1 filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity . 
+1 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
-1 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
-1 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
-1 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
+1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existXZcia de papai noel era um fato inquestionI]el . 
-1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
-1 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
+1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
-1 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
+1 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck – few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
-1 despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
+1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
-1 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
-1 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
-1 the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
-1 the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
+1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history . 
+1 this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer . 
+1 the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
+1 the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
-1 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
-1 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
-1 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
-1 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
-1 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
-1 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
+1 murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
-1 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
-1 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
-1 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
+1 a muted freak-out
+1 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises . 
+1 she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
+1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
+1 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . 
+1 a gripping drama . 
+1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is . 
-1 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
+1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
-1 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
-1 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
+1 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
+1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
-1 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
-1 i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
+1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
+1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
+1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
-1 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
-1 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
-1 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
+1 a very funny movie . 
+1 you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 
-1 not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were – i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
-1 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
+1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
+1 the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 
+1 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
+1 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
-1 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
+1 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters . 
-1 a grating , emaciated flick . 
+1 a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith . 
-1 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
+1 as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
+1 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
-1 though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clichi . 
-1 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
+1 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . 
-1 low rent from frame one . 
-1 in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
+1  " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
-1 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
-1 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
+1 it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
-1 bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
-1 a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
+1 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
+1 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . 
+1  . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichV} to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
+1 because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 
-1 it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
-1  " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
+1  . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
+1 knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
-1 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
+1 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
-1 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
-1 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
-1 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
-1 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
+1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
+1 not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . 
+1 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
+1 no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
-1 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
-1 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
-1 a bit too eager to please . 
+1 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
-1 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
+1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
-1 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
-1 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
+1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
+1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
+1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
+1 sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
+1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
-1 scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
+1 a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
+1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
+1 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
+1 if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is . 
+1 together [time out and human resources] establish mr . cantet as france's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace . 
+1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
+1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
-1 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
+1 the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
+1 broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
-1 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
+1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
-1 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
-1 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
+1 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
-1 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
-1 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
+1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
+1 it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
+1 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing .

+1 an enjoyable experience . 
+1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
-1 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
+1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement .

+1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .

-1 it's just rather leaden and dull .

-1 slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
-1 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
-1 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
+1 [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
-1 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability .

+1 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory . 
-1 it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
+1 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . 
-1 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
+1 it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
+1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
-1 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
-1 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
-1 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
-1 the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
-1 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
+1 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
-1 parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
-1 it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
+1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical .

+1 it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 
-1 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
-1 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
-1 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
+1 hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
+1 provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
+1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
+1 both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . 
+1 a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
-1 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
-1  " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
+1 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it's also full of sharp , smart satire . 
-1 the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
-1 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling .

-1 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
-1 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
-1 a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
-1 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
+1 a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s . 
+1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .

+1 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
-1 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .

+1 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment .

+1 a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member . 
-1 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
-1 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
-1 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
+1 this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
+1 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
+1 you will likely prefer to keep on watching . 
+1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .

+1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
+1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
+1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .

-1 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
-1 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
+1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
+1 adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
+1 for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
-1 zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
-1 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
+1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
-1 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
-1 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
-1 a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
-1 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
-1 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
-1 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
-1 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
+1 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
-1 in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
+1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
-1 the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
-1 like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
-1 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
+1 it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
+1 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy . 
+1 colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
+1 it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
+1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie . 
-1 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
-1 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
-1 though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
-1 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
+1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
-1 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
+1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
+1 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
+1 whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 
+1 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
+1 once you get into its rhythm . . . the movie becomes a heady experience . 
+1 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
-1 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
+1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
-1 alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
-1 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
+1 good , solid storytelling . 
+1 in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better . 
-1 fluffy and disposible . 
+1 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
+1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
+1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
+1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
-1 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
-1 denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
-1 punitively affirmational parable . 
+1 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 
+1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
-1 nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
+1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
-1 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
-1 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
-1 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
+1 one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
-1 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
+1  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
+1 energetic and boldly provocative . 
+1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
-1  . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
+1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
+1 the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
+1 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
+1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
+1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
-1 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
+1 graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world . 
+1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
+1 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
-1 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
+1 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
+1 an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession . 
-1 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
+1 to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clichV} , an assassin's greatest hits . to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
-1 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
+1 the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
-1 a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
-1 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
+1 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
-1 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
+1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
+1 carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
-1 if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
-1 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
+1 director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims . 
+1 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . 
+1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
+1 a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
-1 it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
+1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
+1 i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
-1 it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
+1 collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
+1 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
+1 a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
+1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
+1 like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
+1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
-1 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
+1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
-1 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
+1 one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
-1 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
+1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
+1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
+1 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
+1 worth a look as a curiosity . 
-1 what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
-1 a puzzling experience . 
-1 stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
-1 a dreary movie . 
+1 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
+1 moving and vibrant . 
-1 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
-1 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
+1 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
+1 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
-1 too silly to take seriously . 
+1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintart's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
-1 the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
-1 as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
+1 a marvel of production design . 
+1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
+1 it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
-1 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
-1 the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
+1 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
+1 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
-1 there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
-1 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
-1 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
-1 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
-1 here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
-1 the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
+1 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
-1 how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
+1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
-1 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
-1 i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
+1 having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
+1 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
-1 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
+1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
-1 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
-1 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
-1 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
-1 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
-1 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
+1 a fascinating and fun film . 
+1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
-1 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
-1 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
-1 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
-1 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
+1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
-1 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
-1 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
-1 the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
-1 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
+1 kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
+1 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
-1 the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
-1 an intriguing near-miss . 
+1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
+1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
-1 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
-1 decent but dull . 
+1 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
+1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
-1 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
+1 if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
-1 seems like someone going through the motions . 
+1 dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
+1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
-1 shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
+1  " birthday girl " is an actor's movie first and foremost . 
+1 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
-1 a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
-1 it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
-1 a relative letdown . 
+1 a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
+1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
+1 thanks to haynes' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act . 
+1 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
-1 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
+1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
+1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
-1 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
+1 when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
+1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
+1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
-1 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
+1 it's a charming and often affecting journey . 
-1 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
-1 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
+1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
-1 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
-1 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
+1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
-1 so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
+1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
-1 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
+1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . 
-1 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
+1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
-1 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
-1 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
-1 no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
+1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
-1 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
+1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
+1 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
+1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
-1 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
-1 [a] mess . 
+1 it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
-1  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
-1 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
+1 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
-1 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
+1 uno de los policiales mIZ interesantes de los ?timos tiempos . 
-1 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
-1 a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
-1 if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
-1 never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
+1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
-1 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
+1 an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
+1 happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
-1 according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
+1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
+1 even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
+1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
-1 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
-1 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichis from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
+1 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
-1 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
-1 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
-1 as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
-1 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
-1 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
-1 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
-1 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
+1 a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
+1 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
-1 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
-1 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
+1 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
+1 a tremendous piece of work . 
+1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
-1 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
+1 while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
-1 a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
-1 ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
-1  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
-1 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
+1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
-1 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
+1 the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
+1 stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
+1 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
-1 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
+1 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
-1 'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
+1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
+1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
+1  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
+1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
-1 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
+1 the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
-1 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
+1 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . 
+1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
+1 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
-1 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
-1 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
-1 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
-1 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
+1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
-1 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
-1 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
+1 feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
+1 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
+1 [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
-1 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
+1 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
-1 his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
-1 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
-1 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
-1 a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
+1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
+1 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
+1 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
-1 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
+1 the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
+1 a chick flick for guys . 
+1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition . 
+1 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . 
+1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
+1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
+1 a remarkable film by bernard rose . 
-1 the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
-1 plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
+1 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
-1 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
+1 even the digressions are funny . 
+1 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 
+1  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
-1 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
+1 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given . 
-1 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
-1  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
+1 if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
+1 the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
-1 highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
+1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman sLv complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
-1 meanders between its powerful moments . 
+1 it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
+1 the pianist is polanski's best film . 
+1 this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
+1  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
-1 queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
-1 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
+1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
-1 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
+1 nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion . 
-1 according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
+1 she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
+1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
-1 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
+1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium . 
-1 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
+1 it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
+1 the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
+1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
-1 fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
+1 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going . 
+1 conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown . 
-1 director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
-1 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
+1 it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
-1 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
+1 the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
+1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
+1 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now . 
+1 seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . 
-1 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
+1 a true-blue delight . 
+1 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
-1 the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
-1 one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
+1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
+1 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
+1 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
-1 don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
+1 smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
-1 there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
-1 belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
+1 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting . 
+1 droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . " 
+1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
-1 i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
+1 maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
-1 it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
+1 as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
+1 parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
+1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
-1 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
-1 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
+1 a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
-1 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
-1 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
-1 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
+1 though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
+1 serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
+1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
+1  the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
-1 disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
-1 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
-1 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
+1 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . 
+1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
+1 it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . 
+1 grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that's all that matters . 
+1 goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 
-1 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
-1 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
-1 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
+1 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
+1 a charming but slight comedy . 
-1 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
+1 a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . 
-1 the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
-1 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
-1 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
-1 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
+1 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better . 
-1 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
+1 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
+1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
-1 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
+1 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
-1 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
-1 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
-1 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
+1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
+1 [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
-1 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
+1 it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
+1 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
-1 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
-1 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
+1 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
+1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
-1 [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
-1 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
-1 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
-1 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
+1 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
+1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 . 
+1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
+1 it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
+1 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
+1 drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
+1 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
+1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
+1 like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
+1 a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
-1 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
+1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
+1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
-1 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
-1 there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
-1 the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
-1  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
+1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
+1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
+1 far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . 
+1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
-1 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
-1 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
-1 a little too pat for its own good . 
-1 phoned-in business as usual . 
+1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
+1 if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is . 
+1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
-1 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
-1 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
-1 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
-1 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
-1 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
+1 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
+1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
-1 more precious than perspicacious
+1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed . 
-1 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
-1 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
+1 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
+1 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
-1 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
-1 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
-1 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
+1 like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
+1 [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
+1 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
-1 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
+1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
+1 amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
+1 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
-1 …a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
+1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
-1 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
+1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
-1 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
+1 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster . 
-1 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
+1 writer/director alexander payne ( election ) and his co-writer jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing . 
+1 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is . 
-1 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
+1 evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
+1 it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications . 
-1 it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
-1 in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
+1 an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
+1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
+1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
-1 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
+1  . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
+1 it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
-1 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
+1 you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here . 
-1 although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
-1 the film is flat . 
+1 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation . 
+1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
-1 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
-1 slick piece of cross-promotion . 
+1 a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters . 
-1 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
-1 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
+1 lead actress gao , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
+1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
-1 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
+1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
+1 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
+1 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
+1 if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness . 
+1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‘direct-to-video' release . 
+1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
+1 the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 
+1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
-1 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
+1 a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
+1  . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
-1 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
-1 at once half-baked and overheated . 
+1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
-1 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
+1  " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . 
+1 watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
-1 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
-1 painfully padded . 
+1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
-1 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
-1 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
+1 presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation . 
-1 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
+1 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
-1 the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
-1 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
-1 it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
-1 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
-1 less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
-1 director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
+1 …an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
-1 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
-1 the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
-1 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
+1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
+1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
+1 a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
+1 gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traicigZ que seguramente se convertira en un nuevo clIZico del gVxero . 
+1 grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
+1 my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here . 
+1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
-1 the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 
-1 when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
-1 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
+1 pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
+1 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
+1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
-1 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
+1 i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
-1 a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
+1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . 
-1 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
-1 the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
-1 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
-1 makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
-1 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
-1 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
-1 holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .

-1 the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
+1 there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us .

-1 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
+1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
-1 the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
+1 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
-1 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
+1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
+1 raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .

-1 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
+1 so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
+1 a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
+1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
-1 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
-1 fails to bring as much to the table . 
+1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
-1 crummy
+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
+1 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
-1 the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
-1 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
-1 …it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
+1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
+1 a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . 
-1 i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
-1 martin scorsese cria um espetaculo visual que nco possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
-1 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
-1 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
-1 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
-1 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
+1 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
-1 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
+1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
+1 the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 
+1 witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
+1 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
-1 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
-1 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
-1 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
+1 most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
-1 i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
+1 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 
-1 family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
+1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
-1 amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . " 
-1 though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
-1 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
+1 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
-1 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
-1 by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
+1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
-1 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
-1 has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
-1 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
+1 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
-1 despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
-1  . . . too dull to enjoy .

-1 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
-1  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
+1 shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 
+1 i like this movie a lot . i like that smith , he's not making fun of these people , he's not laughing at them . 
+1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
-1 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichis and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
+1 cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
+1 a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . 
-1 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
+1 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
+1 the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
+1 blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
-1 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
+1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
+1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
+1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
+1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
+1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
-1 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
-1 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
+1 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 
-1 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
+1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
+1 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film . search it out . 
+1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
-1 a major waste . . . generic . 
+1 a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . 
-1 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
+1  " white oleander , " the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material . 
-1 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
-1 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichid , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
-1 forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
-1 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
+1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
-1 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
-1 below is well below expectations . 
+1 a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
-1 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
+1 it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
-1 there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
+1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
+1 you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
-1 show me the mugging . 
+1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time . 
+1 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
+1 half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film
-1 the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
+1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
+1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
-1 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
+1 el t]`ulo no engad- : la pel]Oula narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentara cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 
-1 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
+1 not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
-1 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
+1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
-1 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
-1 showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
+1 the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
-1 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
+1 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one . 
+1 if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
-1 i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
-1 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
+1 nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
+1 a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
-1 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
+1 i just loved every minute of this film . 
+1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
-1 a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
+1 it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
-1 you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
-1 writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
-1 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
-1 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
-1 the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
-1 if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
-1 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
-1 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
+1 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
-1 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
+1 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
-1 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
+1 makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
+1 overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
-1 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
+1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
+1 sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
-1 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
-1  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
-1 what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
+1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
-1 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
+1 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
+1 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
-1 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
+1 a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama . 
-1 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
+1 there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
-1 a non-mystery mystery . 
+1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
-1 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
+1 she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
+1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
+1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
-1 it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
-1 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
+1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
-1 there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
-1 despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
-1 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
-1 true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
+1 this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
+1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
+1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
+1 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
+1 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
+1 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
+1 you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies . 
-1 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
-1 a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
+1 it's a count for our times . 
+1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
+1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
+1 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 
-1 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
+1 it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . 
+1 serious and thoughtful . 
+1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
+1 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
-1 handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffli . 
+1  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
+1 like these russo guys lookin' for their mamet instead found their sturges . 
-1 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
+1 the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . 
+1 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
+1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
+1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
-1 cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
-1  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
+1 this is one of the year's best films . 
+1 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
+1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
+1 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
+1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
+1 the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . 
+1 you'll end up moved . 
-1 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
+1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
-1 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
+1 a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
+1 davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
-1 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
+1 daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
+1 it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
-1  . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
+1 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
-1 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
-1 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
+1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
-1 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
-1 this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
+1 it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic . 
+1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
+1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clichi-riddled genre can offer . 
+1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
-1 brisk hack job . 
-1 while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
-1 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
+1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
-1 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
+1 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
-1 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
+1 on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
+1 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
-1 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
+1  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
+1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
-1 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
+1 a wry , affectionate delight . 
-1 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
-1 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
+1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
+1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
-1 it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
+1 a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
-1 a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
-1 it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
-1 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
+1 reminiscent of alfred hitchcock's thrillers , most of the scary parts in 'signs' occur while waiting for things to happen . 
+1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
-1 laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
-1 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
+1 continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
+1 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
+1 what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight

-1 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
+1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
+1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .

-1 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
-1 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
+1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
-1 though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
+1 it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
+1 a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
+1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .

-1 a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
+1 [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
+1 bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
-1 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
+1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
+1 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
+1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
+1 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
+1 funny in a sick , twisted sort of way . 
-1  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
+1 jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
+1  " cremaster 3 " should come with the warning " for serious film buffs only ! " 
-1 there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
-1 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
-1 national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
-1 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense .

-1 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
+1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
+1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
-1 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
+1 performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
-1 swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
+1 the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
-1 a sometimes tedious film . 
-1 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
-1 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
-1 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
+1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
+1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
+1 its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
-1 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
-1 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
+1 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet .

+1 spare but quietly effective retelling . 
+1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .

+1 think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch .

+1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
-1 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
+1 astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
-1  " freaky friday , " it's not .

+1 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
+1 [a] strong piece of work . 
+1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .

-1 about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .

+1 [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 
-1 there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
+1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
+1 a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state .

+1  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
-1 showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
+1 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
-1 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
+1 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
-1 flat , misguided comedy . 
+1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
-1 rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .

+1 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication . 
-1 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
+1 as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
+1 like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart .

+1 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
+1 a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary .

-1 the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
-1 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
+1 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . 
+1 lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
+1 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
-1 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
+1 a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
-1 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
-1 they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
+1 the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed . 
-1 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [frangois and michhle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
+1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
+1 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
+1 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
+1 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
+1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
+1 it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
-1 it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
-1 it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
-1 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
-1 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
+1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
+1 it is quite a vision . 
-1 it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .

-1 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
-1 without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
+1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
-1 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
+1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
-1 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
+1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
+1 really quite funny . 
-1 wishy-washy . 
+1 lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
+1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
+1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
-1 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
-1 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
-1 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
-1 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
+1 it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
-1 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
-1 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
+1 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
+1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
+1 the most consistently funny of the austin powers films . 
+1 part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
+1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
-1 this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
-1 even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
+1 it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
+1 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
-1 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
+1 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
-1 the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
+1 tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
-1 a movie to forget
+1 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
+1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
-1 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
+1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
-1 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
-1 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
-1 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
+1 go see it and enjoy . 
-1 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
+1 it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
+1 great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
-1 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
-1 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
+1 the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
-1 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
-1 like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
+1 boisterous and daft documentary . 
+1 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
-1 you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
-1 doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
+1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
+1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
+1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
+1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
+1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
-1 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
+1 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 
+1 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
+1 this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
+1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
+1 [ " take care of my cat " ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
-1 our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
-1 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
-1 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
+1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
-1 a moving picture that does not move . 
-1 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
+1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
-1 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
-1 the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
+1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
+1 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
+1 take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year . 
+1 a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . 
-1 the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
-1 cinematic poo . 
+1 bring on the sequel . 
-1 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
-1 the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
+1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
-1  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
-1 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
+1 spiderman rocks
+1 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
+1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
-1 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
-1 holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
+1 the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
-1 may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
-1 a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
-1 frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
-1 first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
-1 if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
+1 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
-1 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
-1 at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
-1 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
-1  . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
+1 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
-1 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
-1 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
-1 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
-1 just a kiss is a just a waste . 
+1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
-1 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
-1 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
+1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
+1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
-1 flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
+1 a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . 
+1 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality . 
+1 the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
-1 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
-1  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
+1 the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
-1 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
-1 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
-1 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
-1 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
+1 frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
-1 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
-1 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
+1 at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
+1 a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
+1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
-1 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
+1 plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
-1 some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
-1 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
+1 one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
+1 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
+1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs . 
-1 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
+1 it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
+1 its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
+1 both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement . 
-1 we get the comedy we settle for . 
-1 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
-1 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
-1 crikey indeed . 
+1 one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
+1  . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
-1 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
-1 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
+1 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression . 
+1 if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
+1 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film . 
-1 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
-1 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
+1 what a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 
+1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
+1 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
+1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
+1 savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
+1 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
-1 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
-1 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
-1 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
+1 like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
-1  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
+1 the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
+1 farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
+1 what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is . 
-1 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
+1 a true pleasure . 
-1 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
+1 [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
-1 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
-1 what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
+1 absorbing character study by andri turpin . 
+1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
-1 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
+1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
+1 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
+1 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise * * * . 
+1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
+1 i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
+1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
-1 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
-1 a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
+1 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . 
-1 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
-1 anemic , pretentious . 
+1 it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
-1 more maudlin than sharp . 
-1 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
-1 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
-1 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
-1 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
-1 an extremely unpleasant film . 
+1 may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
-1 this thing is just garbage . 
-1 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
+1 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
-1 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
+1 a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
+1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
-1 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
-1 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
+1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
-1 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
+1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
-1 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
+1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
+1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out . 
-1 entertaining enough , but nothing new
+1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
+1 the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
+1 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
-1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
-1 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
+1 there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him . 
+1  " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . " 
-1 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
+1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
-1 too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
-1 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
-1 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
-1 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
-1 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
+1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
+1 if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . 
+1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
+1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
+1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but … in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has – ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
-1 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
-1 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
-1 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
-1 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
+1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
+1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 
+1 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
+1 what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
+1 takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
+1 playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
+1 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
+1 it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 
+1 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
+1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
+1 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
+1 el peso de un l]]uido incoloro , el peso del l]]uido vital , del amor como elemento de vida , y de muerte . . . 
-1 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
+1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 
-1 what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
-1 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
-1 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
-1 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
+1 a solidly entertaining little film . 
+1 a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
+1 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie . 
+1 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
+1 it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
+1 unflinchingly bleak and desperate
-1 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
-1 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
-1 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
+1 hardly a film that comes along every day . 
-1 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
-1 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
-1 just not campy enough
-1 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
-1 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
-1 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
+1 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
+1  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
+1 you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
+1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
-1 schindler's list it ain't . 
+1 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
-1 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
+1 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
+1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
+1 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
-1 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
-1 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
+1 you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
+1 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
-1 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
+1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
+1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
-1 the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
+1 solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
-1 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
+1 i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
-1 a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
+1 if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
-1 here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
+1 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
+1 robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
+1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
-1 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
-1 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
-1  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
+1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
+1 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
-1 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
-1 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
+1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
-1 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
-1 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
-1 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
-1 if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
+1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 
-1 the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
-1 instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
+1 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
+1 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it . 
-1 it's one long bore . 
-1 i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
-1 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
-1 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
+1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
+1 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
-1 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
-1 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
-1 there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
-1 a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
-1 there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
-1  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
+1 familiar but utterly delightful . 
-1 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
-1 the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
-1 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
+1 it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
+1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
-1 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
-1 great story , bad idea for a movie . 
-1 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
-1 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
-1 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
-1 wait for it to hit cable . 
+1 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
-1 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
-1 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
+1 with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
-1  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
+1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
-1 [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
-1 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
+1 successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
-1 not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
+1 by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
-1 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
+1 [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
-1 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
+1 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
+1 a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
-1 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
-1 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
-1 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
-1 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
+1 oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
+1 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 
-1 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
+1 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
-1 suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
-1 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
-1 it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
+1 standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
-1 don't even bother to rent this on video . 
-1 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
-1 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
-1 low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
+1 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
-1 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
+1 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
-1 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
-1 once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . 
+1 the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
+1 [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
+1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
+1 it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
-1 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
+1 ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family . 
+1 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
+1 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
-1 horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
-1 solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
+1 it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
+1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
+1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
+1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
+1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
-1 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
-1 pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
+1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
-1 yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
+1  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
+1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film . 
-1 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
-1 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
-1 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
-1 a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
-1 [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
-1 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
+1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
+1 [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
+1 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
+1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .

+1 the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .

-1 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
-1 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
-1 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
-1 the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
-1 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
+1 all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable . 
+1 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon

-1 all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
-1 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
+1 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
-1 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
-1 the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
+1 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias romIUticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
+1 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
-1 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
-1 slap me , i saw this movie . 
+1 it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
-1 though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
+1 with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare . 
+1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
-1 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
+1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
-1 a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
-1 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
+1 classic cinema served up with heart and humor
+1 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
-1 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
+1 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit . 
-1 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
-1 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
+1 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense . 
+1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
+1 quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perdLv do trocadilho ) , nLv ha como negar o brilhantismo da argumentaTLo de seu diretor . 
-1 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
+1 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind . 
+1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
-1 barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
-1 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
+1 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
-1 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
-1 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
+1 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . 
+1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
+1 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
-1 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
-1 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
+1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
-1 almost gags on its own gore . 
-1 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
-1 it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
+1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
+1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
+1 rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
+1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
+1 this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . 
+1 fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
-1 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
-1 this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
+1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
-1 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
-1 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
-1 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
+1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
-1 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story .

-1 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
+1 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
-1 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
+1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic .

-1 national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
-1 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
-1 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
-1 beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
+1 the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters . 
+1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
-1 a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
+1 though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
+1 there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
-1 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clichi atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
+1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
-1 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
+1 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
-1 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
+1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
+1 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
-1 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
+1 the best film of the year 2002 . 
+1 the performances are uniformly good . 
-1 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
+1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
-1 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
-1 it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
+1 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 
+1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
+1 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment . 
-1 degenerates into hogwash . 
+1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
+1 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
+1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
-1 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
-1 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
+1 a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot . 
-1 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
-1 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
-1 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
-1 why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
+1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
-1 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
+1 there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
-1 smothered by its own solemnity . 
-1 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
-1 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
-1 jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
-1 hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
-1 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
+1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
+1 what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
-1 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
-1 parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
+1 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
+1 insightfully written , delicately performed
-1 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
+1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
-1 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
-1 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
+1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
+1 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre . 
+1 if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
+1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
-1 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
-1 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
+1 best indie of the year , so far . 
+1 it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
+1 while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
+1 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
-1 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
+1  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
+1 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers . 
+1 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
+1 a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
-1 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
-1 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
-1 the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
-1 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
+1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman . 
+1 comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
-1 tends to plod . 
+1 funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness . 
+1 very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary . 
+1 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
+1  " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
+1 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
-1 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
-1 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
+1 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
+1 parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
-1 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
+1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
-1 jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
-1 proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
+1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
+1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
+1 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
+1 an alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
-1 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
+1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
+1 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
-1 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
+1 there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
+1 by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
+1 awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '
+1 underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough . 
+1 you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
-1  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
-1 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
-1 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
-1 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
+1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
+1  . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations . 
+1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
+1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
-1 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
+1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
+1 once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't , either . 
+1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
+1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 
+1 without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
+1 it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 
+1 broomfield turns his distinctive 'blundering' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
-1 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
-1 no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
-1 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
-1 it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
+1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
-1 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
+1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast . 
+1 the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking … because you get it . 
-1 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
-1 humor in i spy is so anemic . 
-1 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
+1  " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
+1 worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
-1 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
+1 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
+1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
+1 he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
+1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
+1 a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
-1 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
+1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
-1 the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
+1 it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
+1 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 
+1 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
-1 borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
-1 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
-1 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
+1 the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
-1 if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
-1 an often unfunny romp . 
+1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
-1 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
+1 nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . 
+1 move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
-1 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
-1 black-and-white and unrealistic . 
-1 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
-1 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
-1 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
-1 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
+1 this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
-1 ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
+1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
-1 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
+1 fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
+1 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
+1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
+1 evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
+1 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
-1 if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
-1 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
+1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
-1 this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
+1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
-1 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
+1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
+1 if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
+1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
+1 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 
+1 en sm mismo el rey legZ es un espectIJulo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
-1 one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once .

+1 os problemas tXY in]Oio a partir do momento em que sa]Yos do cinema e comeSJmos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver . I entLv que sinais realmente desaponta . 
+1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
+1 rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
+1 the film has several strong performances . 
-1 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
-1 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
+1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
+1 quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
-1 the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .

-1 an opportunity missed .

+1 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
-1 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
+1 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
-1 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
-1 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
-1 cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .

+1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
-1 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress .

-1 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes .

-1 it's all surface psychodramatics . 
+1 it will break your heart many times over . 
-1 directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .

+1 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
+1 even if the ring has a familiar ring , it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
+1 kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
-1 dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?

+1 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
-1 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad .

-1 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
+1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
-1 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
+1 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
+1 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
+1 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes . 
+1 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .

-1 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
+1 the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
-1 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
+1 writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal . 
-1 this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
-1 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
+1 bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent . 
+1 a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
+1 the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
+1 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 
-1 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
-1 it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
+1 though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
-1 draggin' about dragons
-1 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
+1 it's a very valuable film . . . 
-1 the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
+1 there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
-1 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
+1 this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . 
+1 a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'cherish' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
+1 an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
-1 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
+1 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
+1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
+1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
-1 an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
+1 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
+1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
-1 the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
+1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
-1 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
-1 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
-1 it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
-1 a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
-1 absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
-1 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
-1  . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
-1 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
+1 red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
-1 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
-1 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
+1 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
+1 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichV} and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
+1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
+1 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
+1 overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
-1 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
-1 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
-1 final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
-1 these characters become wearisome . 
-1  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
-1 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
-1 [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
+1 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
-1 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
+1 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air . 
+1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
+1  . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
-1 build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
+1 [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
-1 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
+1 lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
-1 meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
+1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
-1 like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
-1 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
+1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
+1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
-1 spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
-1 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
-1 the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
-1 this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
+1 smart and taut . 
+1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
+1 a riveting story well told . 
-1 pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
-1 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
-1 vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
-1 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
-1 green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
+1 a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . 
-1 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
+1 ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
-1 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
-1 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
+1  . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
+1 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
-1 director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
-1 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
-1 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
+1 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
+1 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
+1 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
+1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . 
-1 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
-1 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
-1 the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
-1 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
-1 what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
+1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
-1 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
+1 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
+1 good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . 
+1 this is one of polanski's best films . 
+1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
-1 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
-1 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
-1 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
+1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
-1 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
+1 it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
-1 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
-1 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
+1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
+1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
-1 starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichis . 
+1 whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
+1 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
+1 a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away . 
+1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
-1 an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
+1 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 
-1 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
-1 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
-1 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
+1 filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . 
+1 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
+1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
-1 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
+1 sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
+1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
-1 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
+1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
-1 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
-1 if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
-1 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
-1 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
+1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
-1 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
-1 once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
+1 the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 
+1 morvern rocks . 
-1 sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
-1 a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
-1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
+1 otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
-1 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
-1 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
+1 this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
-1  " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
+1 if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x . 
+1 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance . 
-1 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
-1  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
+1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
+1 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
-1 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
-1 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
-1 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
-1 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
+1 polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
+1 it's never dull and always looks good . 
-1 the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
-1 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
+1 douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
+1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . 
+1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
+1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
+1 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
-1 just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
-1 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
-1 all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
+1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
-1  . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
-1  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
+1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
-1 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
+1 it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
-1 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
+1 tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
+1 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom — handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 
-1 this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
-1 can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
-1 earnest but heavy-handed . 
+1 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
-1 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
-1 believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
+1 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
-1 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
+1 weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
+1 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense . 
-1 the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
+1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
+1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
-1 egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
+1 it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . 
-1 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
-1 simplistic , silly and tedious . 
-1 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
+1 if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
-1 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
-1 the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
+1 old-form moviemaking at its best . 
+1 jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism . 
-1 a workshop mentality prevails . 
+1 the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 
+1 [hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
-1 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
-1 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
-1 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
-1 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
-1 focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
-1 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
-1 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
+1  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
+1 if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
-1 there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
-1 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
-1 too simple for its own good . 
+1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
+1 as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
-1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
+1 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
-1 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
+1 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
+1 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
-1 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
-1 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
-1 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
+1 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
+1 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
-1 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
+1 post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
+1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
-1 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
+1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
-1 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
+1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
-1 a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
-1 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
-1 doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
-1 while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
-1 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 
-1 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
-1 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
-1 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
-1 execrable . 
-1 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
+1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
+1 if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
-1 the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
-1 there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
+1 missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
-1 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
+1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
-1 when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
+1 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
+1 the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 
-1 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
+1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
-1 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
-1 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
-1 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
+1 the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
-1 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
-1 a real snooze . 
-1 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichis . 
+1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
-1 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
-1 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
+1 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
-1 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .

+1 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
-1 did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
+1 there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
+1 while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying . think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind . 
+1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
-1 uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
-1 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
+1  . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
+1 moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . 
-1 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
-1 opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
-1 what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
-1 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
+1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
+1 likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
+1 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . 
-1 demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
+1 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . 
-1 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
+1 witty , touching and well paced . 
-1 there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
-1 this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
-1 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
-1 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
-1 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
+1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
-1 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
+1 time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
-1 the film can depress you about life itself . 
+1 as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
+1 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
+1 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
-1 demands too much of most viewers . 
-1 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
+1 in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
-1 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
+1 what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
-1 too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
-1 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
-1 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
+1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b?tner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
+1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
-1 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
+1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
+1 an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
+1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
+1 its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
-1 it bites hard . 
-1 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
+1 this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are . 
+1 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
-1 howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
+1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
-1 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
-1 leaks treacle from every pore . 
-1 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
-1 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
+1 an original gem about an obsession with time . 
-1 banal and predictable . 
-1 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
+1 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
+1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
-1 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
+1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
-1 mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
+1 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
+1 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .

+1 [a] rare , beautiful film . 
+1 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller .

-1 it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
+1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
+1 it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
+1 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
+1 'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
+1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
-1 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
+1 davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
+1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
-1 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
-1 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
-1 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
-1 earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
-1 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
-1 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
-1 it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
-1 tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
-1 with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
+1 high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast . 
+1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
-1 es triste tener que decirles que lo znico grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . . 
-1 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
-1 it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
-1  . . . hokey art house pretension . 
-1 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
+1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
-1 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
+1 the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
+1 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
+1 the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
-1 how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
+1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
-1 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
-1 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
+1  " its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . " 
+1 a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it . 
-1 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
-1 bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
+1 strange and beautiful film . 
-1 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
-1 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
+1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
+1  . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno . 
+1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
+1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
+1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
+1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
+1 the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
+1 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness — which makes for a terrifying film . 
-1 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
+1 a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
+1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
+1 the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
+1 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
+1 cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
-1 …its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
-1 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
-1 love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
+1 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians . if the '70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy . 
-1 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
+1  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
+1 believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
-1 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
+1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
+1 the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
+1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
-1 a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
+1 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth . 
+1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
-1 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
-1 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
-1 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
+1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
-1 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
-1 not so much farcical as sour . 
-1  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
-1 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
+1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
-1 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
-1 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
-1 hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
+1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
+1 disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical " bedknobs and broomsticks , " which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime . 
+1 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
-1 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
-1 clever but not especially compelling . 
+1 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
-1 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
+1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
+1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
-1 [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
+1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
+1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
-1 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
+1 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 
-1 a chiller resolutely without chills . 
-1 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
+1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
-1 a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
+1 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
+1 in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
+1 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 
-1 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
+1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
+1 es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprendera . 
+1 a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
-1 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
-1 what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
+1 funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking . 
-1 it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
-1 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
-1 a collage of clichis and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
+1 heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
+1 an impressive hybrid . 
+1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
-1 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
+1 entertains by providing good , lively company . 
+1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
-1 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
+1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
-1 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
+1 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . 
+1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
-1 it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
+1 fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
-1 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
+1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
-1 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
-1 'the chbteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
+1 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . 
+1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
-1 in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
+1 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
+1 assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong's versatile stanley kwan . 
+1 you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
-1 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
-1 you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
+1 the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
+1 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman . 
-1 [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
+1 [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
+1 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
+1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
+1 there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
+1 an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
+1 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
+1 narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
+1 my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
+1 one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
-1 this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
+1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
+1  . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games . 
-1 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
+1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
+1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works . 
-1 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
-1 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
-1 incoherence reigns . 
-1 [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
+1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
-1 mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
-1 the film's center will not hold . 
-1 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
+1 what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
-1 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
+1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
-1 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
+1 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
-1 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
+1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
+1 one of the best movies of the year . 
-1 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
+1 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
-1 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
-1 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
-1 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
+1 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
+1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook . 
-1 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . 
+1 it is definitely worth seeing . 
-1 it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
-1 undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
+1 made me unintentionally famous — as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen . 
+1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
-1 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
+1 a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
+1 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films . . . that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect . 
+1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
-1 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
+1 makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
+1 if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . 
+1 a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
-1 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
-1 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
-1 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
-1 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
+1 maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
+1 gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . 
+1 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
-1 i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
+1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
+1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
-1 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
-1 kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
+1 add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
+1 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
-1 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buquel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
-1 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
+1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
+1 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
-1 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
-1 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
-1 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
+1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
+1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
-1 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
-1 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
+1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
-1 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
+1 sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramI[icos para arrancar lINrimas do espectador , o pianista i um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
-1 attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
+1 highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
-1 downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
+1 an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . 
-1 this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
+1 the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 
+1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
-1 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
+1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . 
+1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
-1 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
-1 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
-1 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
-1 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
+1 it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
+1 recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion . 
-1 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
-1 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
-1 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
+1 i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . 
-1 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
-1 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
+1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
+1 its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
+1 a stirring road movie . 
-1 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
-1 if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
-1 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
+1 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
-1 bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
+1 jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
-1 earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
-1 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
-1 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
-1 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
+1 a warm , funny , engaging film . 
-1 well-meant but unoriginal . 
-1 meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
+1 lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
+1 williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
-1 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
+1 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
-1 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
+1 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
-1 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
-1 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
+1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
-1 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
+1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
+1 there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
+1 meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
+1 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
-1 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
+1 a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
+1 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
+1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
+1 it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro . 
+1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke . 
+1 peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
-1 a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
+1 each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments . 
+1 it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn . 
+1 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
+1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
-1 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
+1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
-1 an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
-1 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
-1 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
+1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
-1 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
+1 a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
+1 while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
+1 this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
-1  . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
-1 well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
-1 aggravating and tedious . 
-1 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
-1 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
-1 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
+1 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
-1 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
+1 there's an energy to y tu mama tambiVx . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
+1 the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
-1 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
+1 warm and exotic . 
-1 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
-1 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
+1  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
-1 a well-crafted letdown . 
+1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
+1 macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
+1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
-1 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
-1 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
+1 secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
-1 judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
-1 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
-1 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
-1 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
+1 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
-1 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
-1 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
-1 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
-1 too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
-1 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
-1 no surprises . 
-1 [newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
+1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
-1 unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
-1 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
-1 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
-1 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
-1 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
-1 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichid and too often strains credulity . 
-1 it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
-1 a big fat pain . 
+1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
+1 combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . 
+1 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
+1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
+1 although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
+1 rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie . 
+1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
-1 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
+1 a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
+1 remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
-1 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
+1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
-1 brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
+1 imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
-1 a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
-1 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
-1 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
+1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
-1 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
+1 holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
-1 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
+1 nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
+1 a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy . 
+1 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
+1 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
+1 steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
-1 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
+1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
-1 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
-1 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
+1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
+1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
+1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
+1 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
-1 the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
+1 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 
+1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
+1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
-1 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
-1 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
-1 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
-1 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
-1 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
-1  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
+1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
+1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
-1 what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
+1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
+1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
-1 lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
+1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
+1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
+1 it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 
+1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
-1 some episodes work , some don't . 
+1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
-1 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
+1 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
-1 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
+1 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
-1 hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
-1 i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
+1 a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
+1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
-1 talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
+1 like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
-1 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
-1 it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
+1 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
+1 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . 
-1 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
+1 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise . 
-1 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
+1 what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
-1 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
+1 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
-1  . . . one resurrection too many . 
+1 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . 
-1 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
-1  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
-1 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
+1 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
+1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
+1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
+1 a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness . 
-1 the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
+1 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
+1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
-1 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
+1 a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion . 
+1 a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . 
-1 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
-1 a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
-1 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
-1 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
+1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
-1 hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
-1 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
-1 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
-1 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
-1 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
+1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
-1 some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
-1 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
-1 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
-1 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
-1 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
+1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
-1 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
+1 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
+1 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
-1 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
+1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
+1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
+1 nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
-1  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored . 
-1 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
+1 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
-1 conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
+1 for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outri sexual practice . 
-1 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
+1 one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . 
+1 the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true .

+1 there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
+1 austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
-1 a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
+1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off .

+1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
+1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .

+1 don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some .

+1 with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
-1 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
+1 while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort .

+1 there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible .

+1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
-1 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
-1 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

-1 [a] crushing disappointment . 
+1 if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone .

-1 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
-1 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .

-1 although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .

-1 a less-than-thrilling thriller .

+1 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
+1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
+1 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .

+1 feral and uncomfortable . 
+1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
-1 trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
-1 a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
+1 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
-1 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
-1 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
-1 it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
+1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
+1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
-1 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
-1 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
-1 observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
+1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
+1 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
-1 if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
-1 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
-1 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
+1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
-1  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
-1 her film is like a beautiful food entrie that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
+1 girls gone wild and gone civil again
-1 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
+1 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
-1 it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
+1 a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
-1 has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
-1 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
+1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
-1 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
+1 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
+1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
-1 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
+1 never [sinks] into exploitation . 
-1 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
-1 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
+1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
-1 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
-1 klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
+1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
+1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
+1 in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand . his work with actors is particularly impressive . 
-1 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
+1 the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended . 
+1 it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . 
-1 the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
+1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
-1 gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
-1 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
+1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
+1 i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
-1 the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
-1 cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
-1 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
-1 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
-1 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
-1 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
-1 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
-1 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
-1 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
+1 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
+1 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
+1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
-1 it treats women like idiots . 
+1 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
-1 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
-1 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
+1 works as pretty contagious fun . 
-1 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esti realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algzn tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quiin sabe dsnde lo tiene escondido . '
-1 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
-1 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
-1 a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
-1 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
-1 before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
+1 the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree . 
+1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
-1 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
-1 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
+1 does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
+1 it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
+1 a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 
-1 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
-1 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
-1 it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
+1 raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
-1 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
+1 the film is one of the year's best . 
+1 the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 
+1 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller . 
+1 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
+1 overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
-1 it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
+1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
-1 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
-1  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
+1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
+1 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . 
-1 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
-1 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
-1 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
+1 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
+1 ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
+1 other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
+1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
-1 …the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
+1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
-1 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
-1 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
-1 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
+1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
-1 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
+1 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current . 
-1 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
-1 i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
-1 terrible . 
-1 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
-1 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
+1 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
-1 charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
-1 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
-1 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
-1 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
-1 this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
-1 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
-1 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
+1 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
-1 when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
+1 what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
-1 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
-1 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
+1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
+1 if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life , eisenstein delivers . 
+1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
+1 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
-1 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
-1 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
-1 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
-1 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
+1 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul . 
-1 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
+1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
-1 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
+1 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
+1 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
-1 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
+1 abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 
-1 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
-1 as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
-1 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
+1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
-1 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
-1 cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
+1 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . 
-1 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
-1 it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
+1 mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
-1 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
+1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
-1 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
+1 those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
-1 j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
-1 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
-1 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
-1 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
-1 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
-1 its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
-1 oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
-1 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
+1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
+1 it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
+1 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
-1 the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
-1 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
-1 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
-1 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
-1 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
-1 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
+1 kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble . 
+1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
+1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
+1 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
+1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
-1 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
+1 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
-1 solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
-1  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
-1  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
+1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
+1 unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of…emotional recovery . 
-1 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
+1 lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
+1 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
-1 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
-1 when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
-1 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
-1 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
-1 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
-1 a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
+1 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
+1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
+1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
+1 when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
+1 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
+1 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
+1 the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
-1 loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
-1 a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
+1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
+1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
+1 far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
+1 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny . 
+1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third…emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
-1 the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
-1 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
-1 a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
-1 an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
+1 disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
+1 uplifting , funny and wise . 
-1 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
-1 this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
-1 rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
-1 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
-1 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
+1 that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
-1 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
+1 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
+1 only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony . hopkins . 
+1 hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department . 
+1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
+1 a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
-1 in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
-1 it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
+1 there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . 
-1 the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
-1  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
-1 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
-1 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
+1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
+1 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
+1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
+1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
-1  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
-1 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
+1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
-1 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
+1 even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
+1 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
+1 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
-1 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
+1 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
-1 for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
-1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
+1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
-1 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
-1 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
+1 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight . 
+1 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
+1 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story . 
+1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
-1 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
+1 denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
+1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
-1 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
-1 a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
+1 an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
+1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
+1 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
+1 the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
+1 by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
-1 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
-1 for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
+1 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
+1 disturbing and brilliant documentary . 
+1 the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
-1 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
-1 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
-1 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
+1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
-1  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
-1 a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
+1 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
+1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
-1 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
+1  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
+1 the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years .

+1 the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame . 
-1 coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
+1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
+1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
-1 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
+1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
+1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
-1 like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
+1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
+1 all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
-1 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
-1 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
-1 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
-1 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .

-1 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
-1 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
+1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
-1 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
+1 nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
+1 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
-1 i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
+1 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 
+1 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
+1 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
-1 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
-1 frenetic but not really funny . 
+1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
+1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
+1 a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
-1 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
-1 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
+1 even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
+1 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
-1  . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
-1 the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
+1 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
+1 troubling and powerful . 
+1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
+1 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
+1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
-1 obvious
+1 if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
-1 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
-1 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
-1 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
-1 that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
-1 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichis , depression and bad alternative music . 
-1  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
-1 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
+1 there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
+1 everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .

+1 a weird , arresting little ride . 
-1 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
+1 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
-1 the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
-1 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
+1 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
+1 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
-1 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
-1 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .

-1 the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
-1 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
-1  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
-1 a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
-1 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
-1 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
+1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
-1 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
-1 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
+1 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection . 
-1 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
+1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
-1 pompous and garbled .

-1 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
-1 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
+1 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .

+1 probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . 
-1 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .

+1 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular .

+1 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
-1 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
-1 feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
+1 despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity . 
-1 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
+1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
-1 the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
+1 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
+1 you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
+1 the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
+1 the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster .

-1 fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .

-1 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
+1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
+1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
-1 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
+1 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
+1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
-1 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
+1 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
-1 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
-1 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
-1 in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
-1 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
+1 although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
-1 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
-1 cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
+1 films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
+1 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
+1 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 
+1 a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
-1 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
-1 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
+1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
+1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
+1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
+1 real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
-1 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
-1 a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
+1 the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
+1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
+1 it strikes hardest… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
+1 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
-1 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
+1 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
+1 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
-1 despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
-1 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
+1 if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . 
+1 a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
+1 a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
-1 with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
+1 'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladrgZ de orqu]Peas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '
-1  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .

-1 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
-1 the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
+1 huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face .

+1  . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 
+1 the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
-1 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
+1 highly engaging . 
+1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
+1 spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
-1 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
+1 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
+1 i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
+1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
-1 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
+1 i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
-1 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
-1 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
+1 jacquot's tosca is a treat . 
-1 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
+1 this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . 
+1  . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
+1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
+1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
-1 it tells more than it shows . 
+1 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
+1 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into budAel's casings
+1  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
+1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
+1 there is greatness here . 
-1 let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
-1 they should have called it gutterball . 
-1 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
-1 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
+1 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
+1 there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
+1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
-1 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
+1 film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
+1 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
+1 a lot smarter than your average bond . 
-1 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
+1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
-1 kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .

-1 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
+1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
+1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .

+1 a . . . cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers . 
-1 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
+1 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
-1 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
-1 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
+1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
-1 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
+1 foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
-1 formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
+1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
-1 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
-1 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
+1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
-1 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
+1 while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging . 
-1 mildly entertaining . 
+1 resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
-1 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup .

+1 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
+1 graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 
+1 hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
+1 a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
+1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
+1 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
-1 ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
-1 cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
-1 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
+1 must be seen to be believed . 
-1 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
-1 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
-1 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
+1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
+1 the delicious trimmings…arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute…with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
-1 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
+1 michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
+1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
-1 [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
-1 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
-1 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
+1 watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
-1 my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
+1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
+1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
+1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
-1 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
-1 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
+1 chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original . 
+1 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
-1 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
-1 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
+1 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 
-1 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
-1 an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
+1 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . 
-1 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
+1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
+1 may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
-1 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
+1 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
-1  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
+1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
+1 in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby . 
+1 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
-1 an ugly , revolting movie . 
+1 gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
+1 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
+1 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
+1 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
-1 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
-1 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
+1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
-1 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
+1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
+1 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
+1 williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
+1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
+1 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
+1 many insightful moments . 
-1 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
+1 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
+1 leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
-1 the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
-1 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
-1 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
+1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
+1 amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
+1 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
-1 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
+1 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
-1  . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
-1  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
-1 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
+1 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . 
-1 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
+1 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
-1 how do you spell clichi ? 
+1 it's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects . 
+1 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
+1 idiotic and ugly . 
+1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
+1 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
-1 the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
-1 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
-1 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
-1 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
+1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
-1 dreary tale of middle-class angst
-1 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
-1 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
-1 i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
+1 overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . 
-1 the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
-1 dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
-1 we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
+1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
-1 tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
+1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 
-1 a porn film without the sex scenes . 
+1 intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
+1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
-1 the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
-1 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
-1 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
-1 madonna still can't act a lick . 
-1 falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
+1 dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . 
+1 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveti and sophistication . 
+1 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
-1 as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
+1 brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 
+1 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
-1 works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
-1 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
+1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
-1 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
+1 the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
+1 moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
+1  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
+1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
+1 it's a treat – a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score… grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
+1 i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
+1 a moving and important film . 
-1 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
-1 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
+1 metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
-1 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
-1 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
+1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
-1 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
+1 writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
+1 the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
-1 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
+1 what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion . 
-1 the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
-1 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
+1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
+1 nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
-1 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
+1 weird . rewarding . 
+1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
-1 a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
-1 ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
+1 bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time . 
+1 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
-1 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
+1 this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
-1 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
+1 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
+1 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade . 
+1 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
-1 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
-1 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
+1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
-1 lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
+1 it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
+1 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
-1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
-1 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
-1 'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
+1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
+1 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser . 
-1 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
+1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
-1 the chbteau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
-1  . . . they missed the boat . 
+1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
+1 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble . there isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
+1 a very charming and funny movie . 
+1 slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
+1 there's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here's a glimpse at his life . 
+1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
-1 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
+1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
+1 stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens . 
-1 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
+1 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
+1 a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
-1 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
+1 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
+1 when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
+1 if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
-1 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
+1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
+1 combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
+1 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
+1 if you can push on through the slow spots , you'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
-1 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
+1 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
+1 it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
+1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
+1 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
+1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
-1  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
+1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
-1 teen movies have really hit the skids . 
+1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
-1  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
+1 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
+1 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
-1 one lousy movie . 
+1 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer . 
+1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
-1 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
+1 if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
-1 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
+1 touchi ! 
+1 p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
+1 this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
+1 a portrait of an artist . 
-1 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
+1 a good piece of work more often than not . 
+1 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
-1 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
-1 an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
-1 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
-1 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
+1 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
+1 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
-1 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
-1 the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
+1 piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
+1 the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
-1 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
+1 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
-1 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
-1 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
+1 my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
-1 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
+1 having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
-1 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
-1 if only it were , well , funnier . 
+1 a charmer from belgium . 
-1 deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
-1 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
-1 an uninspired preachy and clichid war film . 
-1 as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
-1 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
-1 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
-1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
+1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
+1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven… [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . 
-1 it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
-1 affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
-1 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
+1 the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 
-1 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
+1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
+1 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
-1 the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
+1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
-1 there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
+1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
+1 photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
+1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
+1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
-1 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
+1 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
+1 until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
+1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
+1  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs – sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
-1 instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
+1 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
+1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
+1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
-1 with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
-1 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
+1 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
-1 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
-1 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
-1 to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
-1 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
-1 it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
+1 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
-1 a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
+1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
+1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
+1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
+1 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
-1 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
+1 an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
-1 it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
-1 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . 
-1 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
-1 always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
+1 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
-1 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
-1 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
+1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
+1  . . . a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll . 
-1 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
+1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
+1 as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres . 
-1 it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
+1 beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
+1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
+1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
+1 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
-1 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
-1 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
+1  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
-1 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
+1 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
+1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
+1 provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
+1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
+1 a compelling film . 
-1 this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
+1  . . . begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
+1 a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society . 
+1  a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we're all in this together . 
-1 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
-1 technically and artistically inept . 
-1 a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
+1 it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
+1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
+1 if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
+1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
-1 who needs love like this ? 
-1 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
-1 a processed comedy chop suey . 
-1 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
-1 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
+1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
-1 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
-1 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
-1 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
-1 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
+1 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
-1 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
+1 [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
-1 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
+1 a small movie with a big heart . 
-1 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
+1 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
-1 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
-1 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
-1 you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
+1 even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
+1 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
+1 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 
-1 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
-1 amid the clichi and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
-1 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
+1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
+1 one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 
-1 insufferably naive . 
-1 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
-1 this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
+1 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
+1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
-1 it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
-1 journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
-1 it's just plain boring . 
+1 every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
+1 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
-1 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
+1 steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
+1  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
+1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
-1 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
-1 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
+1 rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
-1 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
-1 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
+1 it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
+1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
-1 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
+1 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
+1 montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . 
-1 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
+1 first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
-1 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
+1 i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
-1 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
-1 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
-1 if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
+1 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
+1 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 
-1 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
-1 a ragbag of cliches . 
-1 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
-1 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
+1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
-1 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
+1 helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news . 
-1 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
+1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
-1  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
-1 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
-1 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
+1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
+1 it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
-1 it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
-1 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
+1 a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
-1 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
-1 the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
-1 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
+1 baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
-1 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
-1 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
-1 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
-1 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
-1 a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
-1 in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
-1 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
+1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
+1 watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
+1 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
-1 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
+1 jackson is always watchable . 
+1 salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
-1 with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
+1 for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 
+1 hard to resist . 
+1 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
+1 a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
-1 pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
+1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
+1 this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
-1 despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
+1 talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing . 
+1 psychologically revealing . 
-1 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
-1 shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
-1 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
-1 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
-1 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
+1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
-1 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
-1 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
-1 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
+1 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 
+1 exciting and well-paced . 
-1 be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
+1 sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
-1 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
+1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
-1 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
-1 this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
+1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
-1  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
-1 competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
+1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
+1 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled . 
+1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
-1 this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
+1 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
-1 not a stereotype is omitted nor a clichi left unsaid . 
-1 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
+1 there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
+1 pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
+1 it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
+1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
-1 whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
-1 it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
+1 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
+1 if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
+1 mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
-1 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
-1  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
+1 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
-1 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
-1 is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
+1 a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
-1 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
-1 the threat implied in the title pokimon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
-1 the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
-1 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
+1 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
+1 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 
+1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
-1 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
-1 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
+1 the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
-1 you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
-1 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
+1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
+1 ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
+1 it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
-1 [it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
+1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
-1 no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
+1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
+1 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
+1 it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
-1 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
-1 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
+1 the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . 
+1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
+1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
+1 a beautifully observed character piece . 
+1 like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
+1 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
-1 the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
+1 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
-1 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
+1 the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . 
-1 largely a for-fans artifact . 
+1 the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
-1 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
+1 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 
-1 like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
-1 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
+1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
-1 not exactly the bees knees
-1 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
-1 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
+1 has a solid emotional impact . 
+1 mIZ sarcIZtica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos . 
-1 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
+1 it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
+1 without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen . 
-1 blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
-1 my own minority report is that it stinks . 
+1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
+1 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
+1 kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
+1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
+1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
+1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
+1 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
-1 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
-1 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
-1 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
+1  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
-1 dramatically lackluster . 
-1 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
+1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
-1 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
-1 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
-1 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
+1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
-1 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
-1 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
+1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
-1 supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
-1 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
-1 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
-1 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
-1 boring and meandering . 
+1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 . 
-1 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
+1 in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
-1 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
+1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
+1 exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
-1 it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
+1 [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
-1 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
+1 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
+1 sch?te's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
+1 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
+1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
-1 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
-1 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
-1 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
+1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
-1 the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
+1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
-1 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
-1 bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
+1 the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges . 
+1 adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
+1 [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
+1 a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
-1 more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
+1 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
-1 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
+1 an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
+1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
-1 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
+1 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
-1 yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
+1  . . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know . 
+1 the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary . 
-1 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
-1 oozes condescension from every pore . 
+1 thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
+1 [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
-1 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .

+1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
-1 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
-1 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
+1 the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
-1 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
+1 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
-1  . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
-1 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
-1 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
-1 grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
-1 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .

-1 the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
+1 a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .

+1 it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
+1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
-1 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
-1 this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
+1 the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality . 
-1 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
-1 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
-1 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
+1 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists .

+1 you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
+1 after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen .

-1 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
+1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
-1 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 = weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
+1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
+1 the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
-1 comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
-1 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
+1 what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
+1 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . 
+1 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
+1 it makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
-1 what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
+1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
-1 billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
+1 we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher . 
-1 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
-1 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
+1 a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes . 
+1 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
-1 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
-1 a pretentious mess . 
+1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
-1 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
-1 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .

-1 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
-1 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
-1 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
-1 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
+1 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
+1 berling and bVkrt . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
-1 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
-1 the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
-1 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
-1 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
-1  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
-1 a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
-1 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
+1 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold . 
+1 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine .

+1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
+1 an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
+1 made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america's skin-deep notions of pulchritude . 
-1 instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
+1 the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
-1 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
-1 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
+1 gives everyone something to shout about . 
+1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
+1 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
-1 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
-1 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
-1 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
+1 a delirious celebration of the female orgasm . 
+1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
-1 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
+1 like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
-1 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
-1 mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
-1 i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
+1 viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
-1 bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
+1 a deep and meaningful film . 
+1 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
-1 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
-1 although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
+1 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . 
-1 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
+1 the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable . 
+1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
-1 there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
+1 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
+1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
+1 by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing . 
+1 a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
-1 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
+1 some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since " saving private ryan " have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . 
-1 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
+1 the closest thing to the experience of space travel
-1 by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
-1 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
-1 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
+1 a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than " memento " 
+1 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
-1 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
+1 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
-1 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
-1 the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . 
-1 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
+1 if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
-1 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
+1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
+1  . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
-1 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
-1 rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
-1 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
+1 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
+1 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
-1 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
-1 kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
+1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
+1 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
-1 as vulgar as it is banal . 
+1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
+1 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
-1 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
+1 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 
-1 the drama discloses almost nothing . 
-1 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
+1 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , " in the bedroom , " moretti's film makes its own , quieter observations
-1 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
+1 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
-1 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
+1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
-1 the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
-1 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
+1 [it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
-1 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
-1 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
-1 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
+1 it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
+1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
+1 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
-1 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
-1 it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
+1 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
+1 thoroughly enjoyable . 
+1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
+1 [cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots . 
-1 it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
+1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
-1 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
+1 a tone poem of transgression . 
-1 lurid and less than lucid work . 
-1 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
-1 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
+1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
+1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
-1 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
+1 mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way . 
-1 plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
-1 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
+1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
+1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
+1 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
-1 it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
-1 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
+1 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
-1 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
-1 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
-1 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
-1 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
-1 it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
-1 it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ‘em together here . 
+1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
-1 so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
-1 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
+1 this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! 
+1 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
-1 mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
+1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
+1 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
-1 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
+1 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
+1 moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
+1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
-1 the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
-1 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
+1 henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
-1 not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
-1 just a bloody mess . 
+1 atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
+1 affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
-1 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
+1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
-1 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
-1 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
-1 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
+1 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
-1 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
-1 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
-1 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
-1 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
-1  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
-1 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
-1 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
+1 a potent allegorical love story . 
+1 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
-1 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
+1 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
+1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
-1 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
+1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
+1 duvall is strong as always . 
+1 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
+1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
+1 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
+1 it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
+1 a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity . 
-1 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
-1 whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
-1 it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
+1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
+1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
-1 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
+1 although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
+1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
-1 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
-1 it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .

-1 with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
+1  " frailty " has been written so well , that even a simple " goddammit ! " near the end takes on a whole other meaning . 
-1  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
-1 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
-1 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
+1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
-1 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
-1 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
+1 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
+1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
+1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
-1 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
-1 for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
+1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
-1 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
-1 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful clichi in the book at this nonsensical story . 
+1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
+1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
+1 it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
-1 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
-1 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
+1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
-1 astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
-1 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
+1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
-1 a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
+1 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 
+1 the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
-1 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
-1 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
-1 the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
-1 worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
+1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
-1 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
-1 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
+1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
-1 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
-1 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
-1 the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
-1 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
-1 theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
+1 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
-1 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
+1 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
+1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
-1 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
-1 press the delete key . 
-1 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
+1 those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
+1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
+1 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
-1 a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
+1 maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
+1 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind . 
+1 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
-1 no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
-1 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
+1 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
+1 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
+1 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
+1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
-1 both awful and appealing . 
+1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
-1 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
+1 jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma . 
+1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
+1 one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
-1 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
-1 the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
+1 a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown . 
-1 [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
+1 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient
-1 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
-1 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
+1 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
-1 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
+1 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
-1 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
-1 there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
+1 overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . 
-1 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
-1 a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
-1 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
-1 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
+1 it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks . 
+1 its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
-1 `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
+1 director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
-1 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
+1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
+1 i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
-1 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
-1 brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
-1 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
-1 shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
+1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
-1  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
+1 is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet . 
-1 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
-1 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
-1 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
-1 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
-1 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
+1 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 
+1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
+1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
+1 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
+1 rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 
+1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
+1 at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center . 
+1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
-1 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
-1 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
-1 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
+1 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
+1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
-1 it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
+1 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
-1 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
-1 for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
+1 it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
+1 one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
+1 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
+1 a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
-1 it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
+1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
-1 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
+1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
+1 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 
-1 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
-1 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
-1 lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
+1 this amiable picture talks tough , but it's all bluster -- in the end it's as sweet as greenfingers . . . 
-1 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
+1  . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
+1 with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
-1 slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
-1  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
-1 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
-1 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
-1 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
+1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
-1 this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
-1 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
-1 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
+1 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
-1 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
-1 there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
+1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
-1 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
-1 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
+1 [cuargZ has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
+1  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
+1 those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give " scratch " a second look . 
-1 unwieldy contraption . 
+1 a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ? 
+1 'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
-1 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
+1 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
-1 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
-1 too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash .

+1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
-1 the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
-1 the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
-1 a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
+1 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
-1 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
-1 like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
-1 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
-1 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
-1 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
-1 with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
-1 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
+1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
-1 eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
-1 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
+1 somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
-1 by-the-numbers yarn . 
+1 much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
-1 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
+1  . . . a true delight . 
-1 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
+1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
+1 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
+1 it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
-1 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
-1 don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
+1 in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
-1 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
+1 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
+1  " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble . 
-1 more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
-1 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
+1 frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances . . . keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
-1 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
+1 if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
-1 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
-1 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
+1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
-1 wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !

-1 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
-1 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
-1 a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
-1 it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
+1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
+1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
+1 if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
+1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
+1 it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
-1 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
-1 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
+1 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
-1 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
+1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
+1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
+1 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 
+1 a gem of a movie . 
+1 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . 
+1 there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
-1 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
+1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
-1 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
+1 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
+1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
-1 a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
-1 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
-1 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
-1 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
-1 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
-1 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
-1 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
+1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
-1 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
+1 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
-1 you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
-1 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
+1 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
-1 might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
-1 michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
+1 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
+1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
-1 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
+1 the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
-1 i'm just too bored to care . 
-1 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
-1 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
+1 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
+1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
+1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
-1 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
+1 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
-1 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
+1 the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
-1 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
-1 harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
-1 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
-1 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
+1 a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 
+1 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
+1 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
-1 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
-1 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
+1 beautifully produced . 
+1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
-1 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
+1 the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . 
+1 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
-1 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
-1 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
+1 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
-1 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
+1 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . 
-1 not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
-1 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .

+1 lejos del para]_o es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o]Pos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
-1 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
-1 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
-1 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
+1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is .

-1 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
-1 [at least] moore is a real charmer . 
-1 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
+1 it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
+1 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .

+1 boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 
-1 the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
-1 the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .

+1 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
+1 it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . 
-1 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
-1 when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks .

-1 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
-1 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
+1 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
-1 wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
+1 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . 
-1 a bad movie that happened to good actors .

+1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
+1 a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
+1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
-1 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .

+1  . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
+1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
+1 unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile .

+1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .

-1 the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
-1 the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful .

+1 the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
-1  . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
-1 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
+1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
+1 huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women's augustine . 
+1 maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad . 
-1 this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .

-1 death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
+1 you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 
+1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clichi of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage .

-1 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
+1 it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
+1 holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
+1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
-1 if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
-1 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
+1 that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
+1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
+1 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .

-1 the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
+1 tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script .

-1 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
-1 devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
-1 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
+1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces .

+1 one of the funnier movies in town . 
+1 darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
-1 eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
-1 video games are more involving than this mess . 
-1 alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
-1 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
-1 it's just not very smart . 
+1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
-1 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
-1  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?

+1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
-1 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
-1 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
+1 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
+1 leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love . 
+1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
-1 an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
+1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
+1 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
-1 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
+1 obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
+1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .

-1 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
+1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
-1 no way i can believe this load of junk . 
-1 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
+1 a cutesy romantic tale with a twist .

+1 depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles .

-1 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
+1 a vivid cinematic portrait . 
+1  " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
+1 cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
-1 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
-1 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
-1 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
+1 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
+1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem .

+1 an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood . 
+1 japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .

-1 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
+1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
-1 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
+1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .

+1 spielberg's realization of a near-future america is masterful . this makes minority report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever . 
-1 not even the hanson brothers can save it
+1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .

+1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
-1 it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .

+1 the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .

+1 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
-1 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
-1 a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
-1 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
-1 fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
-1 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
-1  if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
+1 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness . 
+1 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
-1 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
-1 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
-1 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
+1 occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
+1 white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it .

-1 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
-1 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
-1 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
+1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
+1 jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger's record into question and explain how the diplomat's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives . 
+1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
+1 there's . . . an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm . 
-1 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
+1 though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
-1 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
+1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
+1 kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
+1 the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
-1 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
+1 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats . 
-1 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
+1 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
+1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
-1 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
+1 i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
-1 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
+1 much monkeyfun for all .

+1 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
-1 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
+1  . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
-1 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
-1 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
+1 more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 = weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema . 
-1 ihops don't pile on this much syrup .

-1 a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
-1 i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
+1 the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
+1 elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy . 
-1 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
+1 the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
-1 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
+1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
-1 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
+1 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
+1  . . . ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters' crises with seriousness and compassion . 
-1 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
+1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
+1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
+1 a thought-provoking picture . 
+1 though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
+1 world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
+1 more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
-1 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
+1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism .

+1 if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
+1 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve .

+1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
+1  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
+1 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
-1 the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .

-1 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
-1 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
-1 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
+1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
-1 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
-1 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
-1 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
-1 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
-1 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
+1 very predictable but still entertaining
+1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
-1 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
-1 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
-1 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
+1 what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
+1 sparse but oddly compelling . 
+1 trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease . 
-1 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichi . 
+1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
+1 return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad . 
-1 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
-1 ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
-1 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
+1 genuinely unnerving . 
+1 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . " 
-1 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
+1  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
+1 on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
-1 diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
+1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
+1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
+1  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
-1 been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
+1 it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
-1 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
+1 working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . 
-1 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
+1 a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
-1 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
+1 the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
+1 merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 
-1 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
+1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
-1 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
-1 now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
-1 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
-1 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
-1 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
+1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
+1 a lovely and beautifully photographed romance . 
-1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
+1 soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
-1 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
-1 so clichid that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
+1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
+1  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
-1 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
+1 worth the effort to watch . 
+1 at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
-1 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
+1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
-1 rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
-1 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
+1 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
-1 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
-1 it recycles every clichi about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
+1 peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments . 
+1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
+1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
-1 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
-1 nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
-1 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
-1 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
+1 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
-1  . . . stale and uninspired . 
+1 the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 
+1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
+1 fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
-1 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
-1 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
-1 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
+1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
+1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
+1 [a] superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene's 1955 novel . 
-1 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
+1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
+1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
-1 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
+1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
+1 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
-1 [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
+1 george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
+1 remarkably accessible and affecting . 
-1 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
+1 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
-1 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
-1 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
-1 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
-1 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
-1 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
-1 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
+1 the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
+1 special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
+1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
-1 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
-1 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
-1 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
-1 the worst film of the year . 
+1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
-1 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
+1 not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
-1  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
-1 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
+1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
+1 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
+1 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
-1 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
+1 a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
+1 audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
+1 a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid . 
+1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in ‘warm water under a red bridge'
-1 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
-1 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
-1 it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
+1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
-1 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
+1 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
-1 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
-1 this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
-1 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
+1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
+1 yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
+1 i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man . 
+1 if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
-1 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichi of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
-1 nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
+1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
+1 an enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
-1 the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
-1 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
-1 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
-1 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
-1 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
-1 a well-acted , but one-note film . 
+1 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
+1 more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
-1 isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
+1 the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
-1 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
-1 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
+1 a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart . 
+1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
-1 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
+1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
+1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
-1 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
-1 woefully pretentious . 
+1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
+1 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
-1 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
+1 there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
+1 a smart , witty follow-up . 
-1 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
-1 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
+1 that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
-1 scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped .

+1 satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time .

+1 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
+1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation .

-1 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .

+1 the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .

+1 the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . 
-1 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .

+1 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable . 
-1 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
+1 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
-1 it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .

+1 they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
+1 it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
-1  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
+1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time .

+1 peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want .

+1 filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
+1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
-1 the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
+1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
+1 this is art paying homage to art . 
-1 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
-1 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
+1 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
+1 tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
+1 it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
+1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .

+1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .

-1 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
-1 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
-1 little more than a frothy vanity project . 
-1 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .

-1 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .

+1 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . 
-1 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit

-1 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
-1 a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
+1 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over . 
-1 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
-1 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .

+1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
+1 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
-1 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
-1 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
-1 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
+1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
+1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
-1 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
+1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .

-1 a sudsy cautionary tale . 
-1 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
+1 at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . 
-1 feels familiar and tired .

+1 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
+1 an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
-1 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated .

+1 offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through . 
-1 shrewd but pointless . 
+1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up .

-1 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
+1 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france . 
+1 labute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .

-1 yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
-1 it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
+1 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
+1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
+1 a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans . 
-1 disjointed parody .

-1 an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
-1 it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
-1 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
-1 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
+1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
+1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
-1 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
-1 true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
+1 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
+1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
+1 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
+1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
+1 as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
+1 claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
+1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
-1 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
+1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
-1 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
-1 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .

+1 a smart , compelling drama . 
+1 jirm hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
+1 a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
+1 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
+1 not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
+1 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 
+1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry .

-1 este i apenas mais um ( longo ) epissdio do programa da mtv . a znica diferenga i que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
-1 a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
-1 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
-1 this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
-1 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
-1 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
-1 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
+1 it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
-1 rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
+1 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
-1 it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
-1  . . . a rather bland affair . 
+1 it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
+1 captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
+1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
-1 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
+1 parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
+1 while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
-1 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
-1 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
+1 [t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
-1 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
+1 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
+1 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years . 
-1 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
-1 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
+1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
-1 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
-1 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .

+1 it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
-1 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
-1 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
-1 this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
-1 goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
-1 deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
-1 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
-1 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
-1 it's an awfully derivative story . 
-1 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
-1 there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
+1 it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
+1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
-1 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
+1 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
+1 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
-1 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
-1 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
+1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
-1 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
-1 woody , what happened ? 
+1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
+1 rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
+1 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
-1 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
+1  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
+1 a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
+1 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
+1 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
-1 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
+1 blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
+1 often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
-1 an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
+1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
-1 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
-1 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
-1 the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
-1 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
-1 the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
-1 it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense .

-1 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
+1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
-1  . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor — but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
+1 fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
-1  . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
-1 shallow . 
-1 both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
+1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
+1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
-1 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
-1 to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
-1 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
+1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
-1 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
+1 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . 
+1 like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . 
-1 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
+1 made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
-1 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
-1 we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
-1 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
-1 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .

-1  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
+1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .

-1 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
+1 full of surprises . 
+1  ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk . 
-1 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .

+1 what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
-1 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
-1 an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .

-1 scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
+1 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
+1 a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers .

-1 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
-1 all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
+1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
+1 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture . 
-1 has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
-1 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .

+1 ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
+1 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
-1 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
+1 it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough . 
-1 it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
+1 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution . 
+1 it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
-1 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
+1 clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises – but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
+1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
-1 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .

+1 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
-1 [a] stuporously solemn film . 
-1 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
+1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .

-1 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
-1 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
+1 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
-1 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
-1 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
+1 more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
+1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
-1 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
-1 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
+1 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
+1 visually striking and viscerally repellent . 
-1 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
+1 like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
-1 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichis the filmmakers could dredge up . 
+1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
+1 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
+1 not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
+1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
-1 there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie .

-1 stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
+1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
+1 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
-1 this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
-1 an empty , purposeless exercise . 
+1 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
+1 a joyous occasion
+1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
+1 a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
+1 blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
+1 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
+1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
-1 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
+1 here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
+1 witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
+1 as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
+1  . . . less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror . 
-1 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
-1 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
-1 suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
+1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
+1 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
+1  . . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over . 
+1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
-1 a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
-1 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
-1 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
+1 an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence . 
-1 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
+1 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another . 
-1 that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
-1 it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
+1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
-1 nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
-1 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
+1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
-1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
+1 it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
+1 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
+1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
-1 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
+1 a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash
+1 rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
-1 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
-1 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
+1 quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
+1 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan . 
-1 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
-1 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
-1 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
-1 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
-1 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
+1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
-1 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
+1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
+1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
-1 too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
-1 a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 
-1 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
-1 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
-1 there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head . 
-1 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
-1 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
+1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
+1 stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
-1 this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
+1 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
-1 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
-1 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
+1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
-1 it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
-1 a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
+1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
-1 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
-1 the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
-1 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
-1 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
+1 kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
+1 the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
-1 even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
-1 the action clichis just pile up . 
+1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
+1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
-1 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
-1 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
-1 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
-1 soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
+1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
-1 a lame comedy . 
-1 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
+1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
-1 this is no " waterboy ! " 
-1 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
+1 a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
-1 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
+1 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
+1 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
-1 the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
-1 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
-1 adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
-1 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
+1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
+1 while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . 
-1 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
+1 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms . vardalos' memories and insights . 
-1 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
+1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
+1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
+1 no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
+1 it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
-1 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
-1 don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
+1 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
+1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
+1 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
+1 an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller . 
+1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection . 
+1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
-1 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
+1  . . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observacigZ de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones . 
-1 a complete waste of time . 
+1 i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
+1 delirious fun . 
+1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
+1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
-1 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
-1 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
+1 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
+1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters . 
-1 responsavel direto pelo fracasso 'artmstico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox nco consegue sequer aproveitar os pouqumssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
-1 long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
-1 the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
-1  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
+1 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
+1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
-1 a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
+1 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
-1 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
+1 [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists . 
+1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
-1 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
-1 what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
-1 loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
-1 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
+1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
-1 even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
-1 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
+1 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
-1 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
+1 murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . 
-1 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
-1 it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
-1 clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
-1 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
+1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
-1 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
-1 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
-1 as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
-1 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
-1 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
+1 a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
+1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
-1 the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
+1 [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
-1 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
+1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
-1 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
-1 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
-1 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
+1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
-1 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
+1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
-1 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
-1 will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
+1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
+1 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
-1 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
-1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
+1 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
-1 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
+1 it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
+1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
+1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter nQ{s' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
-1 formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
+1 it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
-1 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
+1 leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
-1 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
+1 a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
-1 it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
-1 uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
+1 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
-1 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
+1  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
+1 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
+1 it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
-1 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
-1 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
-1 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
-1 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
-1 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
-1 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
+1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
-1 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
+1 on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
-1 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
-1 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
-1 amazingly lame . 
-1 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
-1 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
+1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
+1 while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious . 
+1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
+1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
+1 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
+1 the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
-1 merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
-1 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
+1 it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
-1 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
-1 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
+1 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
-1 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
-1 davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
+1 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
+1 meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
+1 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing . 
+1 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
-1 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
+1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
-1 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
+1 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
+1 i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
+1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
-1 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
+1 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 
-1 only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
-1 it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
+1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
-1 did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
-1 the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
+1 gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
+1 this new time machine is hardly perfect… yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
+1 a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
-1 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
+1 almost peerlessly unsettling . 
+1 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
-1 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
+1 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
-1 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
+1 one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
-1 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
+1 as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
-1 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
-1 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
+1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that — when it comes to truncheoning — it's better to give than to receive . 
-1 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
-1 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
-1 the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
+1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
-1 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
-1 there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
-1 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
-1 … is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
-1 drowning's too good for this sucker . 
+1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
-1 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
-1 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
-1 the film is strictly routine . 
-1 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
-1 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
-1 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
+1 ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . 
-1 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
-1 shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
+1  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
-1 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
-1 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
+1 try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
+1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
-1 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
+1 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
+1 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . 
+1 although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude . 
+1 it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
-1 stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
-1 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
-1 if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
+1 i'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
-1 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
+1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
+1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
+1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
-1 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
-1 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
+1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
+1 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . 
-1 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
+1 jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
+1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
+1 highly watchable stuff . 
+1 chicago pode ati ser um filme divertido e cativante ( como i ) , mas acaba representando um passo que vai na direTLo contrIYia ` evoluTLo dos musicais . 
+1 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
+1 in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
-1  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
+1 if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -– decasia
-1 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
-1 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
+1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
-1 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naof's encounter with the world . 
-1 professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
+1 each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
-1 it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
+1 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
+1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
+1 u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts . 
-1 this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
-1 [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
+1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
+1 it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . 
+1 a marvel like none you've seen . 
-1 this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
+1 isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
-1  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
-1 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
+1 while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . 
+1 it never fails to engage us . 
-1 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
+1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
+1 ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
+1 drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
+1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
+1 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
-1 a listless and desultory affair . 
-1  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
+1 lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
+1 the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
+1 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
+1 for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
+1 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
-1 there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
-1 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
+1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
+1 pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . 
+1 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
-1 the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
-1 comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
+1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
-1 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
+1 it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . 
+1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
+1 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
-1  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
-1 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
-1 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
-1 watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
+1 ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
+1 among the year's most intriguing explorations of alientation . 
-1 the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
-1 simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
-1 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
-1  . . . unbearably lame . 
+1 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 
+1 delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
-1 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
-1 there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
-1 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
+1 takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer
+1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
-1 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
-1 this is amusing for about three minutes . 
-1 the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
+1 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
-1 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
-1 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
-1 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
-1 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
+1 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 
-1 death might be a release . 
-1 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
-1 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
-1 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
-1 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
+1 matches neorealism's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives . 
-1 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
-1 an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
+1 a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life . 
-1 behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
-1 stale and clichid to a fault . 
-1 godawful boring slug of a movie . 
+1 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
-1 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
-1 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
-1 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
-1 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
-1 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
-1 a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
+1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
-1 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
-1  " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
+1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
+1 steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
+1 remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it . 
+1 happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 
+1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
+1 gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
-1 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
-1 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
-1 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
+1 poignant and funny . 
-1 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
-1 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
-1 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
+1 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
-1 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
+1 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
+1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
+1 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
+1 manages to delight without much of a story . 
+1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
-1 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
-1 there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
+1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
-1 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
-1 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
-1 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
-1 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
+1 hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
-1 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
+1 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
-1  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
+1 still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
+1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
+1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
+1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
-1 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
+1 a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
-1 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
-1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
-1 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
+1 oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
-1 in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
+1 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
+1 it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
-1 a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
+1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
-1 walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
+1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
+1 as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
+1 a wonderful , ghastly film . 
-1 all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
-1 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
+1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
+1 a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
-1 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
+1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
+1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
+1 pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
+1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion . 
+1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
-1 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
+1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodgcar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 
+1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
+1 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
-1  " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
-1 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
+1 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
-1 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
-1 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
+1 the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
-1 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
+1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
+1 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
-1 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
+1 ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
+1 compellingly watchable . 
+1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
-1 five screenwriters are credited with the clichi-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
+1 elegant , mannered and teasing . 
+1 a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
+1 it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
+1 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
-1 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
-1 nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
+1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
-1 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
-1 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
-1 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
-1 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
+1 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
+1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
-1 stay away . far away . 
+1 the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
-1 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
-1 odd and weird . 
+1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
+1 a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
+1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
+1 jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
-1 it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
+1 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
-1 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
-1 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
-1 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
-1 a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
+1 the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before . 
+1 this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
+1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
-1 full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
-1 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
-1 a lifetime movie about men . 
+1 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
+1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
-1 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
+1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
+1 every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
-1 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
-1 overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
-1 [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
-1 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
+1 you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions — disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions . 
+1 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
-1 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
-1 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
+1 there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
-1 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
+1 even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie . 
-1 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
+1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
+1 it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn . 
-1 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
+1 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
-1 staggeringly dreadful romance . 
-1 too much of the humor falls flat . 
-1 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
+1 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
-1 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
-1 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
+1 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
-1 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
+1 spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
+1 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
+1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
-1 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
-1  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
-1 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
-1 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
+1 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
-1  " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
+1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
-1 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
-1 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
-1 it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
-1 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
-1 a very average science fiction film . 
+1 examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as wiseman's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers . 
+1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
-1 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
-1 new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
-1 arty gay film . 
-1 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
+1 it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
-1 mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
-1 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
+1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
+1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
-1 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
+1 baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
+1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
-1 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
+1 a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
+1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
-1 skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
-1 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
-1 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
-1 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
-1 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
-1 schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
-1 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
+1 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
-1 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
-1 even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
+1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
+1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
-1 the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
-1 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
-1 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
+1 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
-1 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
+1 nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 
+1 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
+1 most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
+1 the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
+1 merci pour le movie . 
+1 goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse . 
-1 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
+1 charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
-1 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
+1 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
-1 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
+1 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
+1 the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
-1 the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
-1 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
+1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . 
-1 blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
-1 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
-1 breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
-1 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
+1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
-1 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
-1 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clichi . 
-1 you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
-1 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
+1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
+1 'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
+1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
-1 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
+1 fantastic ! 
-1 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
-1 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
+1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
-1 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
+1 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
+1  . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
-1 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
+1 insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
+1 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
-1 witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
+1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
-1 the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
-1 this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
+1 ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up . 
+1 miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary . 
+1 a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian . . . life . 
+1 this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
+1 dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . " 
+1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
+1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . . 
-1 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
+1 an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
-1 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
+1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
+1  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
+1 an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
+1 engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched . 
-1 rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
+1  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
+1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
+1  " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . " 
-1 a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
-1 though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
-1 i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
+1 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
-1 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
+1 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
-1 wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
-1 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
+1 for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .

-1 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
-1 i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
+1 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
+1 we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
+1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
+1 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
+1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
+1 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 
-1 ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
+1 lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
+1 I uma pena que , mais tarde , o prg\rio filme abandone o tom de pargPia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichX_ que havia satirizado . 
-1 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
-1 fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
-1 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
+1 what's so striking about jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
+1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
-1 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
-1 welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
-1 mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
+1 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
-1 complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
+1 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
-1 the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
+1  . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 
-1 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
+1 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
+1 the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
-1 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichis that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
-1 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
-1 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
+1 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
+1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
+1 it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
-1 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
+1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
+1 an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
-1 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
-1 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
-1 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
+1 what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
+1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
-1 the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
-1 a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
-1 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
+1 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
+1 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
-1 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
-1 slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
+1 in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep . 
-1 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
+1 a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
+1 director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . 
-1 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
+1 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
-1 the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
+1 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses . 
-1 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
-1 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
+1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
-1 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
+1 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
+1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
+1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
-1 [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
+1 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
+1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
+1 in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel . 
+1 an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
-1 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
-1 doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
+1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
+1 even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
-1 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
+1 it's a masterpiece . 
-1 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
+1 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
-1 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
+1 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
-1 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
-1 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
+1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
+1 the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
+1 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
-1 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
+1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
-1 she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
+1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
-1 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
+1 time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
-1 it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
+1 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
+1 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
-1 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
+1 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
+1 the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
+1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
-1 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
+1 funny and touching . 
+1 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
-1 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
+1 trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
+1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
-1 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
+1 the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
+1 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
+1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
-1 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
+1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
+1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
-1 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
-1 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
-1 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
-1 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
-1 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
+1 walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 
-1 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
+1 there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
+1 it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
+1 by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
-1  . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
-1  . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
-1 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
+1 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
-1 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
-1 it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
-1 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
-1 has all the depth of a wading pool . 
+1 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
-1 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
-1  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
+1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
-1 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
-1 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
+1 this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
+1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
+1  . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
-1 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
-1 it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
+1 tailored to entertain ! 
-1 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
-1 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
+1 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
-1 not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
+1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
+1 escapism in its purest form . 
+1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
-1 a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
+1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
-1 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
-1 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
-1 the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville . 
+1 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it . 
-1 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
-1 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
+1 illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
+1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
-1 feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
+1 a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama . 
-1 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
-1 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
+1 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
-1 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
+1 it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
-1 the movie gets muted and routine . 
+1 while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
+1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
-1  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
-1  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
+1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
-1 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
-1 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
+1 y tu mama tambiVx is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
-1 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
-1 you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
-1 i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
+1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
+1 [d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
+1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
-1 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
-1 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
+1 an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds . 
-1 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
+1 an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them . 
-1 a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
-1 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
+1  . . . mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return . 
+1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
-1 it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
+1 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
+1 read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love . 
-1 un thriller manqui qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dhs la premihre image . 
+1 an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot
+1 nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . 
+1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
+1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
-1 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
+1 forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
+1 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
-1 it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
+1 we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
+1 bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
+1 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance . 
+1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
+1 legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 
-1 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
-1 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
+1 a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . 
+1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
+1 a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present . 
-1 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
+1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
-1 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
+1 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
+1 poetic , heartbreaking . 
+1 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
-1 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
-1 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
+1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
+1 precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . anyone else seen this before ? 
-1 the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
+1 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
-1 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
-1 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
-1 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
-1 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
-1 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
+1 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
+1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
+1 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
-1 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
+1 the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher . 
-1 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
+1 a slight but sweet film . 
+1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
-1 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
+1 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
+1 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 
-1 hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
+1 like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
-1 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
+1 a solid , psychological action film from hong kong . 
-1 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
+1 if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
+1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
+1 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
+1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
-1 an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
+1 woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
-1 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
-1 oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
+1 stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
+1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
+1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
+1 bon appV~it ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation . 
+1 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
-1 feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
+1 the movie is a trove of delights . 
-1  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
+1 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 
-1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
-1 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
-1 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
-1 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
+1 it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
+1 ranks among willams' best screen work . 
+1 yakusho and shimizu . . . create engaging characterizations in imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix . 
-1 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
-1 feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
-1 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
+1 the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
+1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
+1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
-1 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
+1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
+1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
-1 too much power , not enough puff .

-1 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .

+1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
+1 what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking .

+1 an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema .

-1 the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
-1 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
+1 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . .

-1 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
-1 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
+1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet .

+1 there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
+1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
-1 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
-1 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
+1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
-1 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
-1 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
-1 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .

-1 charming , if overly complicated . . . 
+1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .

+1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness .

+1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions .

+1 a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichV} and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
-1 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
-1 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
+1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
+1 the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
-1 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
-1 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
-1 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
+1 charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
+1 this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
-1 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
+1 has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
-1 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
-1 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
-1 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
+1 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
-1 pascale bailly's rom-com provides amilie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
+1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
-1 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
+1 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
+1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
-1 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .

-1 when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
-1 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .

+1 a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . 
+1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
-1 there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
-1 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
+1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
-1 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
+1 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
+1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
-1 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
+1 directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . 
+1  . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
+1  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
-1 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
+1 defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
-1 worthy of the gong . 
-1 initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
+1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
-1 allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
-1 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
-1 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
+1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
+1 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
+1 an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
-1 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
-1 nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
+1 a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling . 
+1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
-1 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
+1 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
-1 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
+1 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
+1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
+1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
+1 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
+1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
-1 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
-1 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
+1 it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
-1 calculated swill . 
+1 a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
-1 avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
+1 if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
+1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
+1 fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
-1 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
-1 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
+1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
+1 garc]M bernal and talancgZ are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
+1 baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
-1 like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
+1 this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
-1 i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
+1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
+1 a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
-1 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
-1 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
+1  . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
-1 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
-1 all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
+1 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
-1 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
+1 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors . 
-1 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
+1 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again . 
+1 family fare . 
-1 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
-1 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
+1 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings . 
+1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
-1 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
-1 anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
-1 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
+1 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
+1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
-1 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
+1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
+1 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
+1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
-1 scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
+1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
+1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
+1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
+1 it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
-1 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
+1 a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
-1 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
+1 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
-1 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
+1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
+1 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
-1 it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
-1 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
-1 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
+1 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
+1 though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
+1 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
+1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
+1 the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . . 
+1 it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
-1 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
-1 guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
-1 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
+1 real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
+1 morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
-1 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
+1 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
+1 a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass . 
+1 a quiet , pure , elliptical film
+1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
-1 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
+1 it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
+1 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster . 
+1 it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout . 
+1 succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
-1 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
-1 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
+1 an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
-1 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
+1 dense , exhilarating documentary . 
+1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
+1 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
+1  . . . a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life's endgame . 
-1 while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
-1 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
+1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
+1 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on . 
-1 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
+1 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
+1 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
+1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
+1 happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music . 
+1 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
+1  " simone " is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality . 
+1 if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
-1 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
-1 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
+1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
+1 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
-1 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
+1 a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child . 
+1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
-1 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
-1 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
+1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted . 
-1 guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
-1 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
+1  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
+1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
+1 a fun ride . 
-1 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
-1 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
+1 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
+1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
+1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
-1 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
+1 the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
+1 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
-1 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
-1 well-made but mush-hearted . 
+1 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
+1 norton holds the film together . 
-1 yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
-1 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
-1 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
+1 jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
-1 i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
-1 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
+1 ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier . 
+1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
-1 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
+1 one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
-1 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
-1 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
+1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
+1 gloriously straight from the vagina . 
+1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
-1 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
-1  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
-1 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
-1 abysmally pathetic
-1 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
+1 tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . 
+1 cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
+1 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
-1 brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichid white-trash situation imaginable . 
+1 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
+1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
-1 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
+1 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you . 
+1 confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
-1 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
+1  . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
+1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
-1 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
-1 the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
+1 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 
+1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
-1 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
-1 a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
-1 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
+1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
-1 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
-1 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
+1 significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . 
-1 you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
+1 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
+1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
-1 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
+1 cho's timing is priceless . 
-1 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
-1 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .

-1 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
-1 the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
+1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
-1 on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
+1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .

+1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure . 
-1 a sour , nasty offering . 
+1 neatly constructed thriller . 
-1 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
+1 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
-1 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .

+1 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals .

+1 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
-1 one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
-1 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
-1 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
-1 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
-1 frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
-1 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
+1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .

-1 a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
+1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
-1 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
-1 it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
-1 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
+1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
-1 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
+1 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
-1 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
-1 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
+1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
-1 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
-1 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
+1 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
+1 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
+1 with this masterful , flawless film , [wang] emerges in the front ranks of china's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
-1 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
+1 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
+1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
-1 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
+1 despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
-1 neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
+1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
-1 imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
-1 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
-1 no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
+1 sleek and arty . 
-1 this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
+1 the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
-1 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
+1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy .

-1 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
-1 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
-1 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
-1 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
-1 just plain silly . 
+1 with " ichi the killer " , takashi miike , japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . . 
+1 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
-1 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
-1 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
+1 the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
-1 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
-1 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
+1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong .

-1 one of the worst movies of the year . 
-1 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .

+1 a melancholy , emotional film . 
-1 one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .

+1 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping . 
+1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
-1 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
-1 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
+1 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
+1 in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
-1 the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
-1 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
+1 tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
-1 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
+1 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
+1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
-1 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
+1 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
+1 the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
-1 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
-1 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
-1 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
-1 a half-assed film . 
-1 will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
+1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
+1 one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
+1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
-1 most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
-1 thin period piece . 
+1 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability . 
+1 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
-1 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
+1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
+1 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
+1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
+1 a riveting documentary . 
-1 witless and utterly pointless . 
-1 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
-1 typical animi , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
+1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
+1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
+1 maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements . 
+1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
-1 the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
-1 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
-1 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
-1 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
-1 [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
-1 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
+1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
+1 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
+1 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
+1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
-1 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
+1 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
+1 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
+1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
-1 god is great , the movie's not . 
+1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
-1  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
-1 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
+1 a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
+1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
-1 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
-1 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
-1 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
-1 everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
+1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
+1 the performances take the movie to a higher level .

+1 steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .

-1 it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
+1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
-1 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .

+1 hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
+1 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
+1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
-1 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
+1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
+1 this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . 
-1 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
+1 the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . 
-1 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
-1 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
-1 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
+1 wise and deadpan humorous . 
-1 mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
-1 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
-1 [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
-1 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
-1 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
+1 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
+1 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy .

+1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
-1 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
-1 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
+1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
+1 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
-1 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
+1  . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
-1 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
-1 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
+1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
-1 thoroughly awful . 
-1 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
+1 the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
-1 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .

+1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
+1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
+1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
+1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
-1 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .

-1 i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
-1 couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?

+1 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
+1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
-1 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
+1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions .

-1 i hate this movie
-1 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
-1 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
-1 as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
+1  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
+1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 
+1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
+1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
-1 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation .

+1 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 
+1 robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
-1 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
+1 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
+1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .

-1 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess .

-1 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
-1 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .

-1 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
-1 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .

-1 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
-1 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
-1 includes too much obvious padding . 
+1 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
-1 it's exactly what you'd expect . 
+1 not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . 
+1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
-1  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
+1 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
-1 serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs .

-1 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
+1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
+1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
+1 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
+1 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
-1 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
-1 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
+1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
+1  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
+1  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
-1 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
-1 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .

+1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
+1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
-1 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clichi has been unturned . but no . 
-1 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
+1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
-1 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
+1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
+1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
+1 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
-1 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
+1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .

+1 one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
-1 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
-1 lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
-1 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
-1 it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
-1  . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
-1  . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be

+1 it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
+1 mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 
-1 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
-1 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
-1 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !

-1 bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .

-1 serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
-1 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naoveti and arbitrary flashbacks . 
+1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
-1 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
-1 the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
-1 most of the action setups are incoherent . 
+1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored .

+1 [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
-1 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
+1 an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation . 
-1 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .

+1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
-1 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .

+1 elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions , love . 
-1 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .

+1 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
+1 undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos . 
+1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
-1 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
+1 the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
-1  . . . a confusing drudgery .

-1 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
-1 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
-1 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
-1 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
-1 a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
-1 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
-1 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
+1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
+1 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
-1 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
-1 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
+1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
-1 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
-1 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
+1 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
+1 a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
+1 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
+1 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast .

+1 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
-1 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
-1 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
+1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
